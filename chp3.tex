\chapter{Audio editing workflows in radio production}\label{sec:ethno}

% link to previous chapter
In pursuit of our ambition to develop better methods for radio production, we want to begin by selecting the aspects of
production on which we should focus our research. This will reduce the scope of the problem and allow us to concentrate
our effort on the area that will create the greatest impact.  However, this decision requires a solid understanding of
the workflows involved in the production of radio, and the challenges radio producers face in their roles.

% radio production is not well documented and hard to access

% current literature is lacking
There are two classic books that document the radio production process. \citet{McLeish2015}, now in its sixth edition,
provides a broad overview of the practice of radio production with an emphasis on editorial, organisational and
business concerns.  \citet{Hausman2012}, currently in its ninth edition, covers the more practical aspects of radio
production including the use and operation of tools and equipment.  Despite the valuable contribution of these
publications, they present a high-level overview of production practice that does not fully address the real-life
challenges and issues that radio producers face in the industry.  We want to understand the specifics and complexities
of the radio production process, so that we may gain insights into the authentic challenges producers face in creating
audio content.

% hard for researchers to develop solutions without understanding challenges and problems
% lots of technology could help, but how to choose which?

% technical solutions available, which to choose?
There are many semantic audio and user interface technologies that have the potential to support producers in the
challenges faced when producing radio content. Speech/music discrimination \citep{Wieser2014}, speaker diarization
\citep{AngueraMiro2012}, speaker identification \citep{Lee1999a} and automatic speech recognition \citep{Junqua1995}
can all be beneficial for use in radio systems \citep{Raimond2014,Bell2015}.  However, without a detailed understanding
of the production process, it can be difficult to know which of these technologies have the most potential, or how they
can best be applied to the workflow.
We would like to use our understanding of semantic audio and user interface technologies to discover which of these
can best be usefully applied to the challenges of radio production.

The BBC is the world's biggest broadcaster by number of employees, with over 21,000 full-time staff
\citep[p.~56]{BBC2017a}. It operates ten UK-wide radio networks, six regional services, and 40 local radio stations, in
addition to a global radio service in 29 languages, with over 154M listeners per week \citep[pp.~4, 32]{BBC2017a}.  As
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:background-questions}, we want to exploit our position within the BBC to be able to
capture and share information about the radio production workflow. We hope this might allow other researchers to use
what we learn to guide their research to maximise the benefit to the radio production community.

%Additionally, it can be difficult for researchers outside the industry to contribute developments that
%might benefit radio producers without them having a good understanding of the reality of radio production, or the
%challenges that producers face.

%Previous studies of professional broadcast environments have focused on how producers collaborate during live
%production \citep{Engstroem2010,Perry2009}, by using video recordings to analyse the interactions between producers.

% what we did in this chapter
To help us better understand the radio production process, we conducted three ethnographic case studies of production
practice within BBC Radio.  Section~\ref{sec:ethno-method} outlines the design of our study,
Section~\ref{sec:ethno-results} presents the results of each of our case studies, we discuss our findings in
Section~\ref{sec:ethno-discussion}, and present our conclusions in Section~\ref{sec:ethno-conclusion}.  Finally, in
Section~\ref{sec:ethno-strategy}, we reflect upon what we learned, and the previous research that has been conducted,
to determine an intervention strategy for achieving our research aim.

%\section{BBC Radio}

%The British Broadcasting Company, as the BBC was originally called, was formed in 1922 and started broadcasting daily
%radio programmes from studio 2LO in London \citep{BBC2015}. In 1927, the British Broadcasting Corporation was founded
%by Royal Charter, which defined the BBC's objectives, powers and obligations, and guaranteed its independence from
%government.  The current charter states that the BBC's mission is to ``act in the public interest, serving all
%audiences through the provision of impartial, high-quality and distinctive output and services which inform, educate
%and entertain'' \citep{BBCCharter2016}.

%%9 national stations with 34m listeners, 40 local stations with 8m listeners, one global station in 29 languages with
%%269m listeners

%%funding 
%\subsubsection{Cost}
%The BBC is primarily funded through a television licence fee paid by each UK household that watches live television or
%uses on-demand services. The licence fee allows the BBC's UK services to remain free of advertisements and commercial
%or political interest. The licence fee collects \textsterling3.8B per year \citep{TVLicensing2017}.  This income is
%supplemented by an additional \textsterling210M from BBC Worldwide -- a wholly-owned commercial subsidiary that
%monetises BBC content and brands \citep{BBCWorldwide2017}.

%%by selling international broadcasting rights, DVDs, books, magazines and digital
%%downloads
%% cost of radio
%The BBC spent \textsterling471M on radio production in 2016/17 \citep[p. 111]{Ofcom2017}. Approximately 60\% of this
%was spent on the national radio networks, 25\% of local stations and 15\% on regional services \citep{BBC2017a}.  The
%average cost of producing radio on the national networks in 2p per listener per hour \citep[p.~27]{BBC2017a}.  By
%comparison, television production costs approximately five times more to produce per hour of consumption \citep[pp. 25,
%27]{BBC2017a}.

% location
%\subsubsection{Environment}
%The BBC's national and global radio services are produced in three buildings -- Broadcasting House and Wogan House in
%London, and MediaCityUK in Salford.  Broadcasting House is the worldwide headquarters of the BBC and home of BBC Radio
%\citep{Hines2008}.

%Wogan House is home to Radio 2 and 6 Music, and MediaCityUK is home to Radio 5 Live.


%% technology
%\subsubsection{Technology}
%%This section outlines the technology that is used for radio production within the BBC, based on the author's experience
%%of working there.
%The BBC's radio production activities are centrally operated through a radio production system
%called \textit{dira!  Radio}, made by SCISYS \citep{SCISYS2015}. This system handles audio recording, storage
%management, editing, playout and scheduling. \textit{dira!} integrates with a range of other specialist systems for
%distribution, advanced audio editing, metadata publication, commissioning and rights management.

%There are two audio editing systems used for BBC radio production -- \textit{StarTrack}, which is part of the
%\textit{dira!} production system, and \textit{SADiE} from Prism Sound. StarTrack has basic functionality for cutting
%audio and controlling levels. It integrates directly with the production system, so can be used for editing very close
%to the time of broadcast.  SADiE has much more advanced functionality for controlling sound equalisation and effects,
%and for handling bigger projects.  Other audio editing systems are also used, such as Adobe Audition, but these are not
%officially supported.

\section{Methodology}\label{sec:ethno-method}

% objective of study

The objective of our study was to document the radio production workflow, and to identify opportunities for making
improvements through the application of semantic audio technology.  In addition to making the production process more
efficient, we were also interested in finding ways to improve the quality of radio programmes, and to facilitate the
creative process of producing audio content.  We were interested in using these opportunities to guide the direction of
our research, and to help us decide on an intervention strategy for achieving our research goals. 

% focus on audio editing
Most radio content is broadcast live. In these cases, the content is produced in real-time, so there is no opportunity
to produce the programme any faster. However, many types of programmes, such as documentaries and drama, are
pre-produced using audio editing software. Here, the production process is many times longer than the programme, so
there are opportunities to make the production process more efficient.  For this reason, we chose to focus on studying
the production of pre-produced radio programmes.

\subsection{Data collection}

% LUFF
% ``it is important to observe and analyse work as it occurs'' p.245
% ``researcher cannot know in advance of the study what the relevant features of a particular setting might be in order
%   to isolate and manipulate such features in interviews or questionnaires'' p.245
% ``requirements practice must consider the contrast that may occur between what individuals believe happens in an
%   event and what actually happens'' p.245
% ``many activities are performed repeatedly and become tacit in nature; they are seen but not noticed'' p.245

% ethnography, direct observation
We wanted to exploit our position of working within the BBC by collecting our data through a workplace study at BBC
Radio.  In their book on workplace studies, \citet{Luff2000} argue that ``it is important to observe and analyse work
as it occurs'' and criticise the use of interviews and questionnaires. They point out that a researcher cannot know in
advance what the right questions are to ask participants in an interview, and often there is a difference between what
participants believe they do and what they actually do. As \citet[p.~245]{Luff2000} note, ``many activities are
performed repeatedly and become tacit in nature; they are seen but not noticed''.

We chose to use direct observation to collect our data, where we witnessed radio production first-hand without taking
part.  Producers are very busy and direct observation allowed us unobtrusively to collect the data without adding to
the producer's workload. Additionally we could observe the real-world process, as opposed to a theoretical or reported
one, and take into account the context of the working environment.

% field notes, not video recording
Some studies have successfully used video recording to capture and analyse interactional organisation in the workplace,
which can provide insights into communication and collaboration \citep[p.~16]{Luff2000}.  We were not able to take this
approach for our study as the observation took place at the BBC, whose policies prevented us from using video
recordings in the workplace.  This policy exists to protect the staff's privacy and any sensitive information, which is
often handled by journalists.  Rather than disrupting the workflow and environment of the production team to use video
recording, we recorded the observational data by writing field notes.  In addition to observation, we used free time
between activities to conduct ad hoc, in situ interviews to clarify the participant's workflow and decision-making
process.

% sampling
Due to the scale and variety of the radio operations at the BBC, it would be impossible to cover all production genres
and techniques. To limit the scope of our work, we followed a ``maximum variation sampling'' strategy \citep[p.
172]{Patton1990} to choose a small number of heterogeneous case studies. We selected programmes of different genres to
cover a variety of cultures and work practices.

The time needed to produce programmes can vary significantly, with some being produced over many weeks or months. To
reduce our observation time, we worked with each production team to create a schedule of observations that sampled
every stage of the process and every role in the team. This allowed us to capture the entire workflow without having to
be present throughout.

% recruitment
\subsection{Recruitment}
We recruited participants using an invitation email sent to BBC R\&D's contact list of Studio Managers working in BBC
Radio. Through this process, we recruited three production teams who create the following programmes from the
departments listed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Hourly news bulletin (Radio Summaries, BBC News)
	\item ``15 Minute Drama'' radio drama (London Radio Drama, BBC Radio)
	\item ``The Report'' documentary (Radio Current Affairs, BBC News)
\end{itemize}

These three programmes (news report, drama, documentary) fulfilled our criteria for a heterogeneous sample of
programmes from different genres.

% data collection
\subsection{Procedure}
We used a single researcher to collect the data for our study through direct observation. The researcher observed the
production of each programme from the beginning of audio recording/collection, to the point where the audio had been
finalised. The observation did not focus on a single member of the team, but covered the entire team that
contributed to the audio production. This allowed us to study the different roles involved  and how they interact.  The
production teams were observed in their normal place of work. This allowed us to take into account the context of the
environment in which the teams work, both in terms of the physical location and layout, and of the tools and software
they use to perform their tasks.

We worked with each production team to design a schedule of observation that would cover the entire production process.
Each programme required a different amount of time. Observing the news bulletin took half a day, the drama took two
days, and the documentary took four days.  When the team members were not busy, the researcher used ad hoc, in situ
interviews to ensure they understood the reasons and motivation behind the producer's actions.

The researcher used a laptop computer to type field notes throughout the observation.  The notes specifically included
the following:

%{\singlespacing
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Roles} --- Who are the team members? What are their responsibilities? Which other teams are involved?
	\item \textbf{Environment} --- What is the location? How is the physical space laid out?
	\item \textbf{Tools} --- Which tools are used? For what purpose? How do the users operate them?
	\item \textbf{Tasks} --- What tasks are involved? Who does what? In what sequence do they take place?
	\item \textbf{Challenges} --- Were there any problems or frustrations? Which activities were demanding or mundane?
\end{itemize}
%}

The researcher also took photographs of any relevant locations, tools or other items, with the permission of the
participant.

\subsection{Analysis}

We used the observation notes to populate a list of roles involved in the production and wrote a description of each
of their responsibilities. We wrote a description of the working environment in which the production took place,
including the location, the tools that were used, and how they were used. We also drew a map of the physical
environment, including the spatial layout of the team members.

We used hierarchical task analysis \citep{Kirwan1992,Annett2000} to deconstruct the production process into a sequence
of individual tasks. We assigned each task to the role that was responsible and the location in which it took
place. We then used a partitioned operational sequence diagram \citep{Kirwan1992} to graph the sequence of tasks in
chronological order, arranged into columns to indicate the role and location.

Finally, we identified any challenges that were noted by the researcher, and wrote a description of the current
approach and any suggested improvements that could be made.

\section{Study results}\label{sec:ethno-results}

In this section, we present the results of our three ethnographic case studies. For each study, we describe the roles
and responsibilities of the team members, the environment and tools that were used, the results of the task analysis we
performed, and list the challenges we identified.

%The vast majority of radio production work in the BBC uses a networked audio production system called \textit{dira!}
%\citep{SCISYS2015}. It is colloquially known as `VCS', after the former name of the company that makes it. All audio
%content is kept on distributed storage and the system is accessed using various pieces of software: `StarTrack' is a
%multi-track audio editor, `Orion' is an audio recorder and single-track editor and `Highlander' is used to browse
%recordings and metadata. 

\subsection{News bulletin}\label{sec:news}
The Radio Summaries team at BBC News (known as ``Summaries'') write most of the hourly news bulletins for most of the
national radio networks\footnote{The 6pm and 10pm bulletins, and all of the bulletins for Radio 1, 1Xtra, Asian Network
and Radio 5 are not written by Summaries.}.  The bulletins written by the Summaries team are read live on-air by a
Newsreader at the start of every hour.  The researcher observed the team for five hours during a morning weekday shift,
from 7am to midday. The pace of work in the team was so fast that there was little time to talk to the participants to
ask any questions, so the results are mostly based on direct observation.

\subsubsection{Roles and responsibilities}\label{sec:news-roles}
Summaries is run by an \textit{Assistant Editor} who leads between two and four \textit{Broadcast Journalists}. The
team work 24 hours a day on three eight-hour rolling shifts to report breaking news stories and their developments
throughout the day.

The role of each Broadcast Journalist is to select and write a series of short text summaries of the day's news stories
for a given radio network.  They enhance the summaries by finding, editing and inserting audio clips of reports or
interviews.  Broadcast Journalists produce one bulletin per hour, each between two and five minutes long, with between
four and six stories per bulletin.  The length of the bulletin and number of stories depend on the network and the time
of day. For example, Radio 4 bulletins are longer than other networks, and midday bulletins are longer than those at
other times. Even if the stories being covered are the same, the bulletins for each network are written separately so
that they are targeted to the audience of that network.  This is done by varying the language, tone, amount of detail
and level of assumed knowledge.

The Assistant Editor is the team leader and they assign the responsibility for each radio network to a Broadcast
Journalist.  However, they also perform the same role as the Broadcast Journalists.  Throughout the day, the Assistant
Editor keeps track of the news stories that are developing and decides which of these should be included in the
bulletins. Sometimes they will commission a \textit{Reporter} to record a news report to include in the bulletins. The
Assistant Editor reads and approves each bulletin written by the team to check that they are appropriately worded, have
been fact-checked, and comply with the BBC's editorial guidelines.  The Assistant Editor aims to have the bulletins
approved about 15 mins before the hour, but often new developments mean that bulletins are being edited at the last
minute.  Once approved, the finished bulletins are read out live by a \textit{Newsreader} in a radio studio, who
generally has no direct contact with the rest of the team.

The Summaries team gather audio content by working with the Intake team and directly with Reporters. The
\textit{Intake} team set up and record live incoming audio and video feeds from Reporters in the field. They use an
intercom to notify Summaries of the incoming feeds so that they can listen-in to the live feeds and provide instant
feedback to the Reporter.  Summaries also work directly with individual Reporters that have been commissioned to record
clips for the bulletins. These are recorded and edited by the Reporters themselves and provided to the team directly.

\subsubsection{Environment and tools}
The Summaries team sit together at a single desk in the BBC newsroom at New Broadcasting House in London.  When it
opened in 1932, Broadcasting House was the first purpose-built broadcast centre in the UK \citep{Hines2008}.  Following
a major expansion between 2003 and 2013, Broadcasting House now contains 35 radio studios from which 30 domestic and
World Service radio stations are broadcast, and is the workplace for 6,000 staff \citep{BBCNews2013}.
Figure~\ref{fig:newsroom} shows the newsroom and Figure~\ref{fig:newsroom-layout} shows the location of the team within
the space. The BBC newsroom is the largest in the world and is supported by some 3,000 journalists
\citep[p.~80]{McLeish2015}.  The newsroom houses teams from around the BBC News division and is spatially arranged to
facilitate the fast flow of communication. The teams for each platform (e.g. TV, radio, online) sit together at desks
that fan out from a central area. Decisions on which stories to cover are made in this central area, and are
communicated outwards.

Figure~\ref{fig:news-desktop} shows an example of the desks used by members of the Radio Summaries team. The desk
includes an intercom that can be used to communicate with other teams using labelled ``push-to-talk'' buttons. A
desktop TV monitor is used to keep an eye on the 24-hour BBC News television channel, to track which stories are
currently being reported. Most communication is within the team, which is helped by sitting close together at the same
desk.

\end{figure}


The Broadcast Journalists and Assistant Editor write the summaries on a desktop PC using a software package called
``Electronic News Production System'' (\textit{ENPS}). Figure~\ref{fig:news-enps-edit} shows the ENPS interface. ENPS
is used for writing scripts, compiling and approving news bulletins, and monitoring newswire services\footnote{Newswire
services are global news agencies that provide news reports to subscribing news organisations, such as Reuters and
Associated Press (AP).}. The system is networked so that any changes made in ENPS are instantaneously updated for
everybody. Audio clips are browsed, imported and edited using a plugin called Media Object Server (\textit{MOS}), which
integrates with the \textit{dira!} radio production system.

When Intake upload a clip to \textit{dira!}, it appears on a large screen in the news floor called the ``arrivals
board'' (see Figure~\ref{fig:news-arrivals}). The display includes a reference number which can be used to find the
clip, as well as the upload time and a description. The description often contains the subject, reporter's name and
their location, but the descriptions are written quickly and there is no formal syntax.

\subsubsection{Task analysis}
Figure~\ref{fig:news-flowchart} shows the operational sequence diagram of the Radio Summaries production process. A
description of the workflow with labelled tasks is presented below.

% read newswires
% monitor TV news
% select stories
% commission reporter
% write summary
The Assistant Editor selects which news stories should be included in the bulletins (1). The stories come from multiple
sources, including newswire services and the BBC television news channel.  Newswire reports are accessed through ENPS,
and users are notified of any reports flagged as important (2).  As they work, the Assistant Editor and Broadcast
Journalists use their desktop monitor to keep an eye on the BBC News TV channel to spot any breaking news stories, or
material which they could use in their bulletins, such as interviews (3).  The Assistant Editor will sometimes
commission a Reporter to record a news report for a particular story to ensure that they have good audio content to
include in the summary (4). The Broadcast Journalists and Assistant Editor both write the summaries for a specific
bulletin using ENPS (5).  Previously-written summaries are often re-used, but are updated to reflect the latest
information.

% receive audio from reporter
% receive audio from intake
% monitor TV news
% clip audio
% insert audio
Audio clips are added to each summary to include quotes from interviews and items from Reporters. The audio is sourced
from the Intake team, directly from Reporters and from the BBC News TV channel. Audio from Intake (6) and Reporters (7) is
imported using the \textit{MOS} plugin. The plugin allows users to find audio in the \textit{dira!} radio production
system and edit clips by cutting the audio, and controlling sound levels/fading (8).  Audio from the BBC News TV
channel must be found and clipped by the Broadcast Journalist themselves. The sound from the television channel is
automatically recorded into \textit{dira!} in 40-minute segments. The Broadcast Journalist uses the \textit{MOS} plugin
to browse to the desired segment, find the location of the audio they want, and create a clip of the audio.  Finished
clips are inserted directly into the text of the written summary using a drag-and-drop gesture (9). At this point, the
Broadcast Journalist gives the clip a name and can optionally include the ``in/out words'' that are spoken at the start
and end of the clip.  The name, in/out words and duration of the clip appear in the script.

% edit to time
% submit for approval
% provide feedback
% make corrections
% read bulletin on-air
The finished bulletin must fit an exact time slot (e.g. 120 seconds), so the Broadcast Journalist must estimate how
long it takes to read their bulletin, including the audio clips, and edit the text to the correct length (10).  When a
Journalist has finished writing their bulletin, it is placed into the ``running order'' (11) and named according to the
network and time (e.g. ``R4 Thu 10:00'').  The Assistant Editor then reviews the bulletin and listens to the clips (12). This
is to ensure the bulletin is of the right length, is factually accurate, uses the correct language, and complies with
BBC editorial policy. Any required changes are made either by giving feedback to the Journalist (13), or by the Assistant
Editor making the changes themselves (14).  When the item is approved in ENPS, it is labelled with a green flag, which
indicates that it has been signed-off (15).

The Newsreader sits in a radio studio and normally has no direct contact with the Summaries team.  At the time of the
news bulletin, the Newsreader reads the script directly from ENPS while on-air (16). The audio clips in the script are
automatically loaded into the play-out system, and the Newsreader uses a button to trigger them at the right time.  The
duration and in/out words of the audio clip are displayed in the script, which helps the Newsreader to predict when the
clip will end.

\subsubsection{Challenges}

The Summaries team work under high-pressure circumstances. They have less than an hour to put together several minutes
of content that will be read to millions of listeners. News can break at any moment, so sometimes bulletins need to be
changed or re-written minutes before they are broadcast. In addition to these pressures, it is very important that the
news reports are factually accurate and balanced.  Due to these circumstances, the participants had very little time to
talk to the researcher. During observation, all of the communication between team members was directly related to the
task at hand, and there was no chatting or socialising.

When creating clips from television broadcasts, the journalists must source the clips from 40-minute-long segments.  To
find the audio, they clicked on a waveform to navigate the recording and listened for a particular voice or mention of
the topic of interest.  The \textit{MOS} plugin interface they used displayed an audio waveform, but this did not seem
to help them find the audio.  Finding and cutting clips in this way is a time-consuming and difficult task,
particularly when performed under pressure.  Application of speaker diarization or automatic speech recognition (ASR)
technology could help by indicating when different people are speaking, displaying keywords that are mentioned, or
allowing the recording to be searched as text.

The bulletins written by the Broadcast Journalists must target a specific duration for when they are read.  They have
no indication of how long it takes to read a piece of text. They must therefore estimate this based on experience, or
reading it in their head.  By developing a system that estimates the duration of spoken text, Broadcast Journalists may
be able to target a specific duration more efficiently. 

When it comes to inserting clips into the script, in and out words must be manually entered so that the clip can be
recognised in the text. Ideally this text would include a full transcription, but there is not enough time to
transcribe the whole clip.  ASR technology could be used to help automate this and full transcription could further
help the journalists to recall the clip and write the script around it.

\subsection{Drama}\label{sec:drama}
Radio 4's ``15 Minute Drama'' is a series of original drama and book dramatisations, broadcast twice-daily. Drama
production is very different from most other genres in radio, as it is based on a pre-written script of a radio play.
Each episode takes around two days to produce, but production of the series spans several weeks.  The researcher
observed the production over two full days --- one for the recording of the drama and the other for the editing process.
The observation did not include the writing of the script.

\subsubsection{Roles and responsibilities}
The production team is led by a \textit{Director} who works with a \textit{Broadcast Assistant} and three studio
managers (SMs) --- a \textit{Panel SM}, \textit{Grams SM} and \textit{Spot SM}. The team record a \textit{cast} of
actors who perform the drama.

The Director is responsible for leading the team and making editorial and creative decisions. Before the recording,
they will have commissioned a writer to create the script, and worked with them to refine it. During the recording,
they announce the start and end of takes, give feedback to the cast about their performances, and work with
the SMs to ensure the drama has the right sound.

The Director is supported by a Broadcast Assistant who handles much of the administrative work before and after the
recording, such as making copies of the script, booking the cast, producers and rooms, and processing payments.
During the recording, they annotate the script with detailed notes about the position and length of each take, and mark
any mistakes or re-takes.

The Panel SM is responsible for the sound of the drama. They lead the other two SMs during the recording process,
operate the mixing desk in the cubicle and make backup recordings of the performances onto CDs.  They also work with
the Spot SM to position the actors and microphones to achieve they sound they want.  After the recording, they work
with the Director to edit the drama into the final version.

The Grams SM prepares and plays pre-recorded sound effects during the recording, and is also responsible for recording
the performances using a DAW.  ``Grams'' refers to gramophones, which were historically used to play pre-recorded sound
effects.  After each take, the Grams SM labels the recording with the episode, scene and take numbers, which are later
used to assemble the final programme.  When the Director wants to listen back to a performance, the Grams SM uses the
DAW to find and replay the desired take.

The Spot SM works in the studio, where they set up and position microphones and create ``spot effects'', also known as
``foley'' in the film industry. The effects are produced using a large variety of props that are kept in the studio to
emulate common sounds such as doors, windows, locks, telephones and footsteps to name a few.

The cast are hired by the Director specifically for the drama being recorded. Often the cast are sourced from the BBC
Radio Drama Company (RDC), which is a rotating group of actors that are employed by the BBC. The cast perform the
radio play in the studio, working under instruction from the Director.

\subsubsection{Environment and tools}

The drama we observed was recorded in Studio 60A, which is a purpose-built flexible performance space at BBC New
Broadcasting House in London. The studio contains various spaces with different acoustic properties, including a
staircase with wood, concrete and carpet steps, an upstairs bedroom, a fully working kitchen and a foam-lined spiral
corridor, used to simulate distance.  There are many fixtures and a range of props for re-creating spot effects of
common environmental sounds such as freestanding doors/windows with a variety of knockers and letter boxes. The studio
is a large space, so there are four CCTV cameras which are used to help the producers in the cubicle to see parts of
the studio that are out of sight.

  \caption{Cubicle of studio 60A, showing the view of the Panel SM into the studio.}
  \label{fig:drama-studio}
\end{figure}

The studio is connected by a large acoustically-isolated window to the control room, known as the ``cubicle'', where
the production team sit.  Figure~\ref{fig:drama-layout} shows the layout of the two spaces and
Figure~\ref{fig:drama-studio} shows the view of the studio from the cubicle.  The mixing desk is operated by the Panel
SM and is positioned directly in front of the window.  The Broadcast Assistant sits to the right of the Panel SM and
the Director sits directly behind them. The Grams SM sits at the back of the room, while the Spot SM spends most of
their time in the studio.  The Director, Broadcast Assistant and Panel SM each have an intercom, which they can use to
communicate with people in the studio with a ``push-to-talk'' button.

The Panel SM sets the sound levels and balances the audio using the mixing desk, and makes a backup recording of the
performances using a CD recorder located in a rack to the left of the mixing desk.  Under the mixing desk, there is a
foot pedal which controls a light in the studio, known as a ``cue light'', to silently indicate the start of a
performance. The Panel SM also controls warning lights displayed above the door to the studio to stop people from
walking in during recording.  The Grams SM uses software called ``SpotOn'' \citep{Cridford2005} to select and play
pre-recorded sound effects. They use the ProTools DAW to record audio clips of each performance, and label them with
the episode, scene and take numbers.

Figure~\ref{fig:drama-edit} shows the editing suite where the Panel SM and Director perform the post-production work.
The editing suite is a compact acoustically-treated room which houses a PC running ProTools, stereo speakers, a small
mixing desk and level meters.  The left monitor is used to find pre-recorded sound effects and the right monitor is
used to arrange and edit the audio clips. The Panel SM uses an annotated copy of the script to guide this process.


\subsubsection{Task analysis}
Figures~\ref{fig:ethno-drama-recording} and \ref{fig:ethno-drama-editing} show the operational sequence diagrams of the
radio drama recording and editing processes, respectively. Descriptions of each workflow with labelled tasks are
presented individually below.

  are marked using square brackets in the colour of the take (6). Words are \textcopyright~2014 Marcy Kahan.}
  \label{fig:drama-script}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Recording}
The recording process involves the entire production team and cast. The Broadcast Assistant co-ordinates the team
members by organising the recording date, and booking the studio and cast (1). Between one and two episodes are
recorded in a day.  Prior to recording, the cast will assemble in the ``green room'' with the Director and rehearse the
play (2). During the rehearsal, the Broadcast Assistant measures how long the performances take (3), to ensure they are
not too long or too short.  The Director provides feedback to the cast on their performances (4) before they move to
the studio (5). The Grams SM sets up the studio by arranging acoustic panelling, preparing props and arranging
microphones (6). In the cubicle, the Panel SM sets the sounds levels of the microphones (7), and the Grams SM selects
and loads the sound effects that will be played during the recording (8).

The drama is recorded as a series of ``takes''. Each take is a short segment of a scene, often only 20--30 seconds
long.  Multiple takes of the same material are recorded so that the Director can give feedback to the cast between
takes.  The Director starts the recording process by announcing the episode, scene and take number (9).  The Panel SM
starts the backup recording (10), and the Grams SM starts the DAW recording (11). When everything is ready, the Panel
SM flashes the cue light, which silently signals the cast to start performing (12).  During each take, everybody
listens to the performance (13). The Spot SM performs live spot effects in the studio (14), while the Panel SM balances
the audio levels (15), and the Grams SM triggers pre-recorded sound effects (16).

The Broadcast Assistant annotates a printed script with information about each take (17).  Figure~\ref{fig:drama-script}
shows an example of an annotated drama script.  The start and end of each take is marked with a vertical line on the
side of the page. The take and backup CD numbers are written at the top of each line, and the duration of the take is
written at the bottom.  If the take starts again during a recording, the line continues back to the top.  The best take
for each scene is marked by highlighting the line for that take.  Words that are spoken incorrectly are underlined, and
repeated words or phrases are marked with square brackets.  Different coloured pens are used to distinguish the marks
for each take.  


At the end of a take, the Panel SM stops the backup CD recording (18) and the Grams SM stops the DAW recording (19).
The Grams SM uses the DAW to label the clip with the episode, scene and take number --- for example, ``e2s3t1'' (20).
The Broadcast Assistant marks the printed script and spreadsheet with the length of the take and the backup CD number
(21).  If the Director wants to record another take (22), they discuss the performance with the production team, then
provide the cast with feedback, either by walking into the studio, or using the intercom (23).  If the Director is
satisfied that they have recorded what they need, then they select the best take and move onto the next scene (24). The
Broadcast Assistant marks the best take on the script and spreadsheet, which calculates the current overall duration of
the recording (25).

At the end of the episode (26), the team either move on to the next episode, or the Director sends everybody home (27).
The Grams SM copies the audio clips from the DAW onto a portable hard drive (28).  Portable hard drives are used as
they can handle large file sizes better than than the local computer network.  The hard drive and annotated drama
script are given to the Panel SM to use for editing.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Operational sequence diagram of radio drama editing, partitioned by role and location.}
  \label{fig:ethno-drama-editing}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Editing}
The recordings for the drama are edited into a final programme by the Panel SM and Director. The Panel SM starts by
creating a rough edit of the programme by themself, using the annotated script as a guide.  As the files are stored on
a portable hard drive, this process can be done either in an edit suite or on a laptop at home. The first step is to
import the audio files (1) and create a sequence of the best takes from the recordings, as marked in the annotated
script, by dragging them onto a time-line from the list of labelled clips (2).  The Panel SM uses the script to
identify and remove errors in the takes, such as re-takes or repeated words (3).  They adjust the sound level to be
consistent throughout by using the mouse to draw level curves, or by recording automation using a fader on the mixing
desk (4).

The Panel SM adds any additional sound effects (5) using an effects library on their PC, which contains roughly 900
hours of sound effects.  The effects are found either by using text to search their metadata, or by browsing to
specific collections of effects.  Before the Director joins them, the Panel SM listens through the rough edit (6) to
identify any mistakes or errors, such as repeated words and phrases, or noise caused by actors handling their paper
scripts.  Double-speed playback is used to save time during this process. Any errors that are identified are fixed
before moving on to the next stage (7).

Once the rough edit is complete, the Director joins the Panel SM in the edit suite. They listen to the rough edit to
judge the quality of the performances they previously selected as the best takes (8).  Often, the Director will ask the
Panel SM to play other takes so that they can compare them (9).  To do this, the SM finds the correct recording in the
clip list, drags it onto the time-line and finds the correct position in the clip.  The Director may ask the Panel SM
to swap a take, or combine the start and end of different takes to use the best performances (10).  The same process
happens for the sound effects (11), which may be swapped or mixed together (12).

Music is not specified in the script, so the Director has the freedom to choose what they want (13). Popular consumer
music services such as iTunes are used to find commercial tracks, but often Directors will choose ``production music'',
which is designed for TV/radio and is easier to license. These can be searched using descriptive keywords on one of a
number of online music libraries such as Audio Network\footnote{\url{https://www.audionetwork.com/}} or Desktop
Jukebox\footnote{\url{https://desktopjukebox.broadchart.com/}}.  The Director provides the music to the Panel SM on a
USB storage device for them to add using the DAW (14).

The final programme must have an exact duration to fit its assigned broadcast slot. The programme is often edited to be
slightly too long, so some lines can be removed to reduce the programme length. Removing lines has a strong editorial
impact, so the Director decides which lines to remove (15) and the Panel SM edits them out using the DAW (16).  Once
finished, the final edit is rendered to an audio file by playing the programme in real-time through a digital loop-back
(17). Although this can be done faster, this playback forces the Director and Panel SM to listen to the programme from
beginning to end in one go. If they are happy with the edit (18), the Director sends the file to their Editor for
sign-off and broadcast (19).

\subsubsection{Challenges}
The clear syntax used to annotate the drama script shows that the production workflow is well-organised and makes good
use of existing tools. However to convert those annotations into a rough edit, the SM must use a DAW to manually
arrange and edit the clips, and remove any marked errors. The SM must use the audio waveform visualization to edit the
clips.  As it is difficult to identify the location of the words in the waveform, this can be a lengthy and tedious
process. If the annotations could be captured digitally, the rough edit stage could conceivably be fully or partly
automated.

In addition to being script-based, a defining characteristic of drama production is that multiple takes are recorded in
order to capture the best possible performance. However, there is no simple way to directly compare performances. For
this reason, the Director does not want to compare too many takes, and therefore relies heavily on the script
annotations and written notes. Providing a quick and easy method for the Director to listen to and compare different
takes could potentially lead to selection of better performances.

When actors make a mistake, they often say the line again immediately. This is usually marked in the script with square
brackets. However, these can sometimes be missed and are not easy to spot using the DAW interface.  Audio analysis
techniques could be used to detect and highlight where this happens.

%It takes skill and experience to find the right sound effects
%know which words to use for the search or to know which CDs or collections
%to use for certain effects.

\subsection{Documentary}\label{sec:doc}
``The Report'' is a weekly investigative documentary that covers topical news stories. It is produced over a three week
period by the Radio Current Affairs department in BBC News and is broadcast at 8pm every Thursday on Radio 4. The
researcher observed the team for a total of four days --- one day during their research phase, one day during their
interviewing phase and two days during their editing phase.

\subsubsection{Roles and responsibilities}
The documentary is created by a team of three, made up of a \textit{Producer}, \textit{Presenter} and
\textit{Researcher}.  At certain points during the production, the team is supported by an \textit{Editor} and
a \textit{Studio Manager}.

The Producer leads the team and makes the editorial decisions. They decide what the story-line will be, who to interview
and how the programme is edited together. They pre-interview participants to screen them, record interviews with
them, transcribe those recordings and create a rough edit of the programme.

The \textit{Presenter} is a journalist who is the narrator of the documentary. They work closely with the Producer to
craft the story-line, write the narrative ``links'', conduct interviews and provide feedback to the Producer about the
edit. The Report has a regular Presenter who typically works on two or three documentaries at once.

The \textit{Researcher} assists the Producer with research and investigation. They recruit for, and set up, interviews,
conduct pre-interviews, and transcribe audio. 

The \textit{Editor} leads the Radio Current Affairs department. They do not participate directly in the production of
the documentary, but provide feedback to the team and give approval for the documentary to be broadcast.

A \textit{Studio Manager} (SM) joins the team on the final day of production to turn the Producer's rough edit into
the finished programme. This process includes recording the Presenter, removing redundant speech, adjusting the pace of
the speech, removing unwanted noise and adding music.

\subsubsection{Environment and tools}
The team is based in BBC New Broadcasting House in London, where most of the work takes place in an open-plan office.
This creates challenges for audio production, such as noise, privacy and reliance on headphones for monitoring
\citep{Brixen2003}.  The research for the programme is desk based and does not require any special tools other than a
web browser and phone.

Face-to-face interviews are conducted either on location, in the office building or in a radio studio.  For interviews
outside the studio, a portable audio recorder and microphone are used to capture the audio.  Remote interviews are
conducted by using an ``ISDN''\footnote{Integrated Services Digital Network} link to a local radio studio, an
IP-based call such as Skype, or over the telephone. The telephone is used as a last resort as it has the poorest sound
quality.

The office is located directly beside four radio studios. The studios are organised into pairs so that one can be used
for recordings, with the other used as a cubicle. Each studio is acoustically treated and contains a PC with a DAW,
a mixing desk, speakers, microphones and a telephone connected to a recorder. The studio is used to record remote and
face-to-face interviews, record the Presenter's narration, listen to the programme and edit it into the final
version.

\subsubsection{Task analysis}
Figure~\ref{fig:ethno-docs-workflow} shows the operational sequence diagram of the documentary production.  A
description of the workflow with labelled tasks is presented below.

Production starts with researching the chosen topic of the documentary (1).  The purpose of the research stage is to
form the story-line for the documentary, and to identify people to interview.  Often the topic will be in the news that
week and the Producer will be looking for an interesting angle which can be explored in greater depth.  The Producer
and Researcher listen to news reports and documentaries, read newspaper articles and encyclopedias, and talk to
contacts who know about the subject.  The Producer makes rough notes for themself in Microsoft Word and prepares a
draft outline of the programme (2).

Once the team have identified who they might want to interview, the Producer or Researcher will approach them to see if
they are interested (3).  If the interviewee has the time available, the Producer or Researcher will do a
``pre-interview'' over the phone, which simulates a real interview but is not recorded (4). This is done to see what the
person will say and whether it suits the story-line of the documentary.  Most interviews are recorded face-to-face,
either on-location or in a studio, depending on the situation (5).  During interviews, the Presenter asks the questions
while the Producer records the audio and monitors the levels.  For on-location interviews, the Presenter holds the
microphone and the Producer operates the portable recorder (6).

All of the interview recordings are transcribed (7). Some recordings are sent to a third-party transcription service in
Australia that transcribes the audio overnight.  However, often the programme's budget can only cover transcription of
less than half of the interviews. The rest must be transcribed by the Producer or Researcher. For this, they use
Microsoft Word to manually type the words.  To save time, they will only do a rough transcription by skipping most
words, leaving only enough to get a good idea of what was said.  With both the third-party and manual transcriptions,
timestamps are written every few minutes to help the reader identify the location of the audio.

The interview transcripts are printed onto paper, which the team use to help them collaborate face-to-face.  The team
go through the interview transcripts and mark with a highlighter pen lines that they want to use (8). Notes and labels
are informally written on the page.  After the team have marked-up the interview transcripts, the Producer uses them as
a guide to find and create audio clips of the content they highlighted (9), and piece it together into a rough edit
using a DAW (10). The timestamps written in the transcript are used to help them navigate the audio.

\begin{figure}[p]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/docs-workflow}
  \caption[Operational sequence diagram of radio documentary production, partitioned by role and location.]{Operational
  sequence diagram of radio documentary production, partitioned by role and location.\\ {\footnotesize ($^{*}$some
  interviews are transcribed using a third-party service)}}
  \label{fig:ethno-docs-workflow}
\end{figure}

While the Producer creates a rough edit, the Presenter writes the programme's ``links'' --- the narrative elements that
sit between the interview clips (11). When the first rough edit is complete, the whole team sits down with the Editor
for a ``run-through'' (12). The programme is performed out loud from beginning to end, with the Presenter reading the
links and the Producer playing the clips from the DAW. This allows the Editor to hear the programme and give early
feedback. It also allows the Producer to determine the current length of the programme.  This run-through process
typically happens two or three times for each programme (13).

Once the Editor is happy with the rough edit, a Studio Manager (SM) is brought it to help turn it into the final
programme.  This often happens on the day of the broadcast.  The Presenter records the links (14) with the help of the
SM and the Producer who gives them feedback.  The SM adds the links to the DAW in the correct positions (15). The
Producer chooses any music that they want to add to the programme (16), often production music from an online library.
The SM adds this music to the programme, along with the programme's theme music (17).  The SM cleans up the interview
clips by removing redundant noises (e.g. ``umm'') and phrases (e.g. ``you know''), and ensures a good pace by removing
long pauses (18). However, some redundant noises or pauses are left in because they are difficult to remove or
editorially relevant.  The SM also balances the sound levels by recording automation using a fader on the mixing desk
or by dragging in/out fades. 

Once all of the elements have come together, the Producer and SM work together to cut the programme down to a specific
duration, in this case 27 minutes and 45 seconds (19). This is done by removing sections of speech, usually from the
beginning and end of interview clips.  The finished programme is played to the Editor for their approval (20), and any
final changes are made by the Producer (21).  Once the programme is signed-off, the documentary is rendered to an audio
file and imported into the \textit{dira!} radio production system. The Producer must then listen to the entire
programme in \textit{dira!} to ensure the audio that will be broadcast contains no errors (22).

\subsubsection{Challenges}
The documentary production relied heavily on printed transcripts, which allowed the team to collaborate and make notes.
However, transcription is expensive if done using a third-party, and time-consuming if done by the team.  Transcripts
can give an idea of what was said, but it is difficult to navigate the audio to listen to how it was said. Rough
timestamps are usually written every few minutes, which helps the Producer by narrowing the search area. However, they
must use the audio waveform to find the specific word or sentence of interest. After the transcripts are annotated,
the Producer has to go back and manually edit the selected parts of the interviews. The navigation process of
timestamps and audio waveforms makes this a slow and tedious process.  Creating a tighter link between the printed
transcripts and the audio recordings would allow the Producers to work with transcripts as normal, but to
simultaneously navigate and edit the audio content.

The Studio Manager used a DAW to manually remove redundant noises such as ``umm''s.  Finding and removing these noises
is slow and difficult. If an acoustic model of redundant noises and phrases could be developed, these could either be
highlighted for easier identification, or removed automatically.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:ethno-discussion}
Our study investigated audio editing workflows in radio production using three ethnographic case studies. We identified
three themes from the results of the study: waveform navigation, textual representation and the use of paper. We
discuss each of these themes below.

\subsection{Waveform navigation}
In all of the case studies we observed, the audio was navigated using a waveform representation.  In the news bulletin,
the journalist often had to search for a quote in a 40-minute clip using only the audio waveform and a rough idea of
the location of the quote.  In the drama production, the SM used a waveform to navigate and edit the audio within each
clip to match the annotations made on the script.  In the documentary production, the Producer assembled their final
programme by using a waveform to find, cut and arrange each audio clip marked on the transcript.

As we discussed in Section~\ref{sec:background-waveforms}, audio waveforms are limited in the information they can
display, which makes it difficult to identify words, sentences and speakers.  This can make it difficult for the
producers to navigate and edit the audio content, as the location of their desired content in not apparent using the
waveform. In Section~\ref{sec:background-waveforms-related}, we saw that previous work has used scaling and colour to
enhance audio waveforms. These approaches may be able to provide producers with a richer visualization that would make
it easier to identify the desired region of audio.

%In the documentary production, the audio was represented using printed transcripts. Timestamps
%were written in the transcript every few minutes to help producers locate the original audio, but some searching was
%required to find and listen to the desired words.  In the drama production, scripts were used to refer to the audio
%content. Each take was labelled with its episode, scene and take number. However, comparing multiple takes was a
%process of manually importing and aligning the desired clips.  News bulletins are written as text, but designed to be
%spoken aloud. Estimating the time it takes to speak the words required the journalist to either read the words in their
%head, or estimate the time based on experience.

%This disconnection from the audio means that often producers are making decisions based on an abstract representation of
%the sound, such as text. The producers we observed used timestamps and labels to link to the audio, but
%these links had a low precision and only reduced the area in which the producer had to search to listen to the audio.
%Creating a more direct link from the text to the audio would allow producers to listen to the audio with greater
%precision and efficiency. For example, if each word was labelled with a precise timestamp, an audio playback device
%could instantly seek to that exact moment in the recording. More direct access to audio content
%could allow producers to make better decisions on what content to include in their programme.

\subsection{Textual representation}
We observed that in all three case studies, the producers interacted with audio using a textual representation. A
script was used to refer to and mark-up the audio recorded in the drama. The documentary Producer transcribed all of
their interview recordings, and used the transcripts for most of the production. The news bulletin producers also used
text to label and insert ``out-words'' of the audio clips in their scripts.

Sound is a medium that must be experienced over a period of time, so listening to large quantities of audio can be
slow. Representing audio using text allows users to quickly glance through and search audio content without having to
invest time in listening. Text can be used to display word-for-word what was said, but it cannot display how it was
said. The nuances of the spoken word can contain deeper meaning, which may not be visible in a written
transcript. Despite this, the documentary Producer we observed chose to work with text rather than directly with the
audio, which demonstrated that they found value in using a textual representation.

Generating transcripts of speech can be an expensive process. We saw that the documentary Producer could only afford to
pay for transcription of less than half of their interviews, so had to transcribe the rest themselves, which took a
long time and produced poor quality results.  As we saw in Section~\ref{sec:asr}, ASR
could make this process faster and more affordable. We also saw in Section~\ref{sec:background-transcripts} that
semantic speech editing interfaces can be used to edit audio content using a transcript-based interface. However, ASR
transcriptions contain errors and it is not known how these would affect the usability of such transcripts in a radio
production environment.

\subsection{Use of paper}
We saw that in both the drama and documentary productions, the teams used printed scripts or transcripts as part of
their workflow. The two reasons we could identify for using paper rather than a screen interface were to make
handwritten annotations, and to facilitate face-to-face collaboration.  The drama production team used scripts to help
them coordinate what they were recording, and to make annotations that were later used as a guide to edit the
programme. The documentary Producer printed the transcripts of their recordings to help them collaborate face-to-face
in deciding which parts to use, then marking their selections using a highlighter pen.

Paper is a flexible medium that can be handed around, pointed at and annotated freely, amongst other things.  However,
with both the documentary and drama, edit decisions that were written on paper had to be manually translated into audio
edits using a DAW. This is a tedious and slow process. If these annotations could be captured in a structured digital
format, they could then be automatically translated into audio edit commands. This may save producers time and effort
without deviating much from their existing workflow.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:ethno-conclusion}
We investigated audio editing workflows in radio production by conducting three ethnographic case studies in BBC
Radio. The case studies covered production of a news bulletin, a drama and a documentary.  Through direct observation,
we documented the roles, responsibilities, environment, tools and challenges of each production, and used task analysis
to deconstruct and graph the tasks of each programme's workflow.

We observed that all of the radio producers navigated and edited audio using a waveform visualization. We saw that
radio producers often work with textual representations of audio, rather than with the audio recordings directly, to
help them search and navigate content more efficiently.  The drama and documentary producers used paper scripts to make
freehand annotations and facilitate face-to-face collaboration.  We identified opportunities to assist the challenges
of radio production using richer audio visualization, automated speech recognition and digitisation of paper
annotations.

\section{Intervention strategy}\label{sec:ethno-strategy}

In this chapter, we described three ethnographic case studies that gave us insights into the challenges and
opportunities that exist within the radio production process.  We are now in a position to reflect upon our research
aim (Section~\ref{sec:aim}) and research questions (Section~\ref{sec:background-questions}) to determine a strategy for
achieving our goal.

Our investigation into radio production practice uncovered three themes. Each of these provide an interesting avenue
of research to be explored. In this section, we describe our plan for investigating these individually through
technical intervention.

\subsection{Audio waveforms}

In all of the case studies, producers used audio waveforms to navigate their audio content.  As we saw in
Section~\ref{sec:background-waveforms}, waveforms display limited information which can make them difficult to use for
navigation.  However, despite their widespread use, the author could not find any studies that attempted to measure the
performance of audio waveforms.  Section~\ref{sec:background-waveforms-related} described several promising methods for
enhancing audio waveforms by using colour to add semantic information. However, the author could not find any formal
evaluations of these methods.

To answer our research question on the role and efficacy of audio visualization (see
Section~\ref{sec:background-questions}), we will perform a user study in Chapter~\ref{sec:colourised} to evaluate the
performance of audio waveforms and colour-enhanced visualizations. Our interest is in using audio visualization
techniques to make the production of radio programmes more efficient.  Therefore, we will design an audio visualization
that uses colour enhancement to support a radio production task.  We will evaluate our visualization using audio
content that is representative of radio broadcasting, and measure the efficiency of users in completing the task using
our visualization. Due to the lack of formal studies of both methods, we will not only compare our colour-enhanced
visualization to normal waveforms, but also measure the performance of normal audio waveforms themselves.

\subsection{Semantic speech editing}

The producers in all three of our case studies interacted with audio content using textual representations. We also saw
that the documentary producer wrote transcripts of all their interviews.  In Section~\ref{sec:asr}, we described how
ASR can be used to automatically transcribe speech, and in Section~\ref{sec:background-transcripts} we saw that
transcripts have been successfully used to allow for semantic navigation and editing of speech content.

As we discussed in Section~\ref{sec:background-questions}, \citet{Rubin2013} demonstrated a system for the production
of ``audio stories'', which has many similarities to radio production.  However, this system was not formally
evaluated, so it is still unclear what effect semantic editing has on the radio production process. Other semantic
editing systems have been formally evaluated \citep{Whittaker2004,Yoon2014,Sivaraman2016}, but they were designed for
navigating and editing voice messages and comments, which use a different style of audio content and have different
requirements from radio production.

To answer our research question on how transcripts can be applied to radio production (see
Section~\ref{sec:background-questions}), we will investigate in Chapter~\ref{sec:screen} whether semantic speech
editing can be used for radio production by designing and developing a semantic speech editor for radio production, and
evaluating it through a user study.  To ensure that the results relate to real-life requirements, we will use our
access to BBC Radio to recruit professional radio producers, and evaluate semantic speech editing for use in production
of genuine radio programmes.  To measure its performance, we will compare semantic speech editing to the current
production workflow.

\subsection{Paper interface}

In two of our three case studies, producers used paper scripts and transcripts as part of their production workflow.
This allowed them to collaborate face-to-face and to describe their audio edits using annotations. The remainder of
their production workflow was digital, and transferring between the paper and digital representations was a manual
process.  It may be possible to use technology to ``bridge the gap'' between paper and digital, which may have benefits
to the radio production workflow.

This finding about the use of paper within radio production was unexpected, but provided an interesting new avenue for
our research. This gave rise to an additional research question that we wanted to address in this thesis:
\\

%\hangindent=15pt
%\hangafter=1
\textbf{Question 4:} What is the potential role of augmented paper in radio production?
\\

In Chapter~\ref{sec:paper}, we will investigate how augmented paper can best be applied to radio production, and
develop and evaluate a system for producing radio content using a paper interface.  To ensure that our system fulfils
the real-life requirements of radio production, we will evaluate it for use in the production of genuine programmes by
professional producers.  We will compare this approach to a fully digital workflow by measuring our system against a
similar screen interface. To understand the benefits of paper-digital integration, we will measure the performance of
the system with and without the integration between the two.
