\chapter{Audio editing workflows in radio production}\label{chp:ethno}

% link to previous chapter

We saw in Chapter~\ref{chp:colourised} that we can improve the performance of at least one audio editing task by
enhancing the audio visualization. We were interested in exploring how we could apply these techniques to radio
production, to help producers create programmes more efficiently.  To continue this research, we needed to decide which
production tasks we should target. This required an understanding of the tasks involved in radio production, and of the
challenges producers face in their roles.

% radio production is not well documented and hard to access

%Radio production is conducted globally on a large scale. The BBC alone has 9 national and 40 local radio stations,
%%and BBC World Service, which broadcasts in 29 languages. 
%each of which broadcast 24/7.

There are two classic books that document the radio production process. \citet{McLeish2015}, now in its sixth edition,
provides a broad overview of the practice of radio production with an emphasis on editorial, organisational and
business concerns.  \citet{Hausman2012}, currently in its ninth edition, covers the more practical aspects of radio
production including the use and operation of tools and equipment.  Despite the valuable contribution of these
publications, they present a high-level overview of production practice that does not fully address the real-life
challenges and issues that radio producers face in the industry.

It can be difficult for those working outside of the radio industry to learn about the challenges of radio production.
We could only find one published study that involved radio producers, by \citet{Dunaway2000}, which was based on his
experience of being a documentary producer. This lack of studies may be a result of the limited number of radio
producers, and their demanding workload, which can make it challenging to recruit them for research.  For example,
\citet{Kim2003} worked with National Public Radio (NPR) to develop a system for searching speech archives.  Despite
working directly with NPR, they were unsuccessful in recruiting radio producers to evaluate their system as there were
not many producers, and they did not volunteer because they were too busy.

% hard for researchers to develop solutions without understanding challenges and problems
% lots of technology could help, but how to choose which?

There are many semantic audio and user interface technologies that have the potential to improve the radio production
workflow. Speech/music discrimination \citep{Wieser2014}, speaker diarization \citep{AngueraMiro2012}, speaker
identification \citep{Lee1999a} and automatic speech recognition \citep{Junqua1995} can all be benefitial for use in
radio systems \citep{Raimond2014,Bell2015}. However, it is difficult to know how best to apply these techniques without
a solid understanding of the radio production process.

Without a good understanding of how radio production works in reality, and the challenges that producers face in their
work, it can be difficult for researchers outside of the industry to contribute developments that might benefit radio
producers.

Previous studies of professional broadcast environments have focused on how producers collaborate during live
production \citep{Engstroem2010,Perry2009}, by using video recordings to analyse the interactions between producers.
The scope of this study was much wider and covered the production of programmes over a number of weeks. As such, an
ethnographic approach was taken so that all aspects of the production could be considered.

Experiments into the use of higher-level representations like text are starting to appear, such as the video editors
from Loviscach \citep{Loviscach2011a} and Hyperaudio \citep{Boas2011}.

However, without a detailed understanding of the production workflows, it can be difficult to know which of these
technologies have the most potential, or how they can be integrated into the workflow.

% what we did in this chapter
To help us better understand the radio production process, we conducted three ethnographic case studies of practice in
BBC Radio.
In Section~\ref{sec:ethno-method} we outline the design of our study.
Section~\ref{sec:ethno-results} presents the results of each case studies,
Section~\ref{sec:ethno-discussion} discusses the findings and
Section~\ref{sec:ethno-conclusion} presents the conclusion.

\section{Methodology}\label{sec:ethno-method}

% objective of study

The objective of our study was to document the radio production workflow, so we could identify opportunities for making improvements through the application of semantic audio technology.

% focus on audio editing
Most radio content is broadcast live. In these cases, the content is produced in real-time, so there is no opportunity to produce the programme any faster. However, many types of programmes, such as documentaries and drama, are pre-produced using audio editing software. Here, the production process is many times longer than the programme, so there are opportunities to make the production process more efficient.

\subsection{Data collection}
% ethnography, direct observation
We used ethnographic research methods to study the culture of radio production in BBC Radio. We chose to use direct observation to collect our data, where we witnessed production first-hand without taking part.
We did this so that we could observe the real-world process, as opposed to a theoretical one, and take into account the context of the working environment. Additionally, producers are very busy and direct observation allowed us to collect the data without adding to the producer's workload, while being as unobtrusive as possible.

We recorded the data by writing field notes during observation. We were not able to use video or audio recording as much of the observation took place in open-plan offices that deal with sensitive information. We also used any time between activities to ask the participants clarifying questions.

% sampling
Due to the scale and variety of the radio operations at the BBC, it would be impossible to cover all production genres
and techniques. To limit the scope of our work, we followed a ``maximum variation sampling'' strategy \citep[p. 172]{Patton1990} to choose a small number of heterogeneous case studies. We aimed to select programmes that varied in genre, as we speculated that these would have different cultures and work practices.

The time needed to produce programmes can vary significantly, with some being produced over many weeks or months. To reduce our observation time, we worked with the producer of each programme to create a schedule of observations that sampled every stage of the process. This allowed us to capture the entire workflow without having to be present throughout.

% recruitment
\subsection{Recruitment}
We recruited participants using an invitation email sent to BBC R\&D's contact list of studio managers working in BBC Radio. This process put us in touch with three producers who were interested in participating. The producers worked on the programmes and in the departments listed below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Hourly news bulletin (Radio Summaries, BBC News)
	\item ``15 Minute Drama'' radio drama (London Radio Drama, BBC Radio)
	\item ``The Report'' documentary (Radio Current Affairs, BBC News)
\end{itemize}

These three programmes (news report, drama, documentary) fulfilled our criteria for a heterogeneous sample of programmes from different genres.

% data collection
\subsection{Procedure}
We used direct observation to collect the data for our study with a single researcher. The researcher observed the production of each programme from the beginning of audio recording/collection, to the point where the audio had been finalised. The observation did not focus on a single member of the team, instead covering the entire team that contributed to the audio production. This allowed us to study the different roles and how they interact.
The production teams were observed in their normal place of work. This allowed us to take into account the context of the environment in which the teams work, both in terms of the physical location and layout, and of the tools and software they use to perform their tasks.

We worked with the producer of each programme to design a schedule of observation that would cover the entire production process. Each programme required a different amount of time. Observing the news bulletin took half-a-day, the drama took two days, and the documentary took four days. 

The researcher typed or hand-wrote field notes throughout the observation and interviews. When the team members were not busy, the researcher asked clarifying questions to ensure they understood the reasons and motivation behind the workflow. The notes specifically included the following:

{\singlespacing
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Roles} -- Who are the teams members? What are their responsibilities? Are any other teams involved?
	\item \textbf{Environment} -- What is the location? How is the physical space laid out?
	\item \textbf{Tools} -- What purpose are the tools used for? How do the users operate the tools?
	\item \textbf{Tasks} -- What tasks are involved? Who does what? What sequence do they take place?
	\item \textbf{Challenges} -- Were there any problems? Which activities were demanding or mundane?
\end{itemize}
}

The researcher also took photographs of any relevant locations, tools or other items, with the permission of the participant.

\subsection{Analysis}

We started by populating a list of roles involved in the production, graphed the political structure and wrote a description of each of their responsibilities. We wrote a description of the working environment in which the production took place, including the location, the tools that were used, and how they were used. We also drew a map of the physical environment, including the spatial layout of the team members.

We used hierarchical task analysis \citep{Kirwan1992,Annett2000} to deconstruct the production process into a sequence of individual actions. We assigned each action to the role that was responsible and the location in which it took place. We then used a partitioned operational sequence diagram \citep{Kirwan1992} to display the sequence of tasks from top to bottom, arranged into columns to indicate the role and location.

Finally, we identified any challenges that were noted by the researcher, and wrote a description of the current approach and any suggested improvements that could be made.

\section{Study results}\label{sec:ethno-results}

In this section, we present the results of our three ethnographic case studies. For each study, we describe the roles and responsibilities of the team members, and the environment and tools that are used. We then detail the results of the task analysis we performed, before listing the challenges we identified.

%The vast majority of radio production work in the BBC uses a networked audio production system called \textit{dira!}
%\citep{SCISYS2015}. It is colloquially known as `VCS', after the former name of the company that makes it. All audio
%content is kept on distributed storage and the system is accessed using various pieces of software: `StarTrack' is a
%multi-track audio editor, `Orion' is an audio recorder and single-track editor and `Highlander' is used to browse
%recordings and metadata. 

\subsection{News bulletin}\label{sec:news}
The Radio Summaries team at BBC News (known as ``summaries'') write news bulletins for the national radio
networks\footnote{Other than Radio 1, 1Xtra, Asian Network and Radio 5, which are handled by separate teams.} that are read live on-air by a newsreader at the start of every hour.

The researcher observed the team during a morning weekday shift. The pace of work in the team was so fast that there was little time to talk to the participants to ask any questions, so the results are mostly based on direct observation.

\subsubsection{Roles and responsibilities}\label{sec:news-roles}
Summaries is run by an \textit{assistant editor} who leads 2--4 \textit{broadcast journalists}. The team work 24 hours a day on three rolling shifts to help keep track of developing news stories. The role of each journalist is to select and write short text summaries of news stories to be read out on a particular network. They must find and edit audio clips to accompany those stories and construct them into a bulletin of a set length.  The assistant editor performs the same role as the journalists, but is also responsible for assigning the bulletins to the team, deciding which stories to prioritise, and to read and approve each news bulletin. The finished bulletins are read out live by a \textit{newsreader} in a radio studio.

Summaries work closely with other news teams to gather audio content. The `\textit{intake}' team set up and record live
incoming feeds from \textit{reporters} in the field. They notify summaries of the incoming feeds so that they can
listen-in and provide instant feedback. The `\textit{newswire}' team provide curated clips of both BBC and
user-generated content. Summaries also work with individual \textit{reporters} who are commissioned to record clips for
the bulletins. These are recorded and edited by the reporters themselves and provided to the team directly.

\subsubsection{Environment and tools}
The team sit together at a large desk in the BBC newsroom (see Figure~\ref{fig:newsroom}), which also houses teams from
around the BBC News division.  The working environment is configured to facilitate fast flow of communication, which is
reflected in the design of the newsroom and the equipment on the desks.  Each space at the desk has a PC, telephone,
intercom, TV monitor and headphones. The intercom is used to communicate with other teams in the newsroom, and the TV
monitor displays the BBC News channel. However by design, most communication is face-to-face.

\end{figure}

Most of the work is based at a desktop PC and primarily done on the Electronic News Production System (ENPS). This is
an industry standard software package for writing scripts and compiling news bulletins. It integrates with the
\textit{dira!} radio production system using a plugin called Media Object Server (MOS). This allows users to browse and
edit audio clips within ENPS (see Section~\ref{sec:news-clips}).

\subsubsection{Task analysis}
Each journalist produces one bulletin per hour, each between two and five minutes long, depending on the network and
the time of day (e.g. midday bulletins are longer). Even if the stories being covered are the same, the bulletins for
each network are written separately so that they suit that network's audience. This is done by varying the number of
items, the amount of detail and the level of assumed knowledge. The team aims to finish bulletins 15 mins before they
are aired.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3in]{figs/news-workflow.pdf}
  \caption{Flowchart of news summaries production.}
  \label{fig:ethno-drama-recording}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Scripts}
Using ENPS, the team write text summaries of the current big news stories and compile them into a bulletin. The
information comes from a variety of sources, but mainly from the news wires (e.g. Reuters) and BBC reporters.  The
finished bulletin must fit an exact time slot, so much of the work and skill is in knowing how long the text will take
to read and being able to condense the story down to the key points. 

\paragraph{Audio clips}\label{sec:news-clips}
Each bulletin contains a number of audio clips which help to break up the newsreader's voice and make the piece more
engaging.  Relevant audio content is selected, edited to an appropriate length and inserted into the news script.  All
clips are stored in \textit{dira!} and the MOS plugin is used to find, edit and insert the clips into ENPS (see
Figure~\ref{fig:news-enps-edit}).  This uses \textit{dira!} Orion which offers basic cutting, levels and fading
functionality. When a clip is finished, it is dragged onto the script at the point in the text where it should be
played. The user must give the clip a name, and can optionally add the in and out words\footnote{The 2/3 words spoken
  at the beginning and end of the recording.}. These and the clip duration appear in the script which helps the
journalists and newsreader.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/news-enps-labelled.pdf}
  \caption{Editing a clip in ENPS using the MOS plugin for \textit{dira!}.}
  \label{fig:news-enps-edit}
\end{figure}

Audio content comes from a variety of sources including the intake team, newswire team, and individual reporters (see
Section~\ref{sec:news-roles}).  Off-air content from the BBC News TV channel is also used.  For off-air recordings, the
journalists must find and clip the audio themselves. Sound from the TV channel is automatically recorded into
\textit{dira!} in 40-minute chunks. The recordings are navigated using the MOS plugin, which only displays a waveform
and timeline. Without knowing what time the clip starts, the journalists resort to skipping through the 40 minutes
listening out for a familiar voice or word, which can be time-consuming and frustrating.

\paragraph{Playout}
When a journalist has finished the scripts for their bulletin, these are placed into a `running order' which is named
with the network and time (e.g. `R4 Thu 10:00'). The assistant editor then reviews the scripts and listens to the clips
to ensure they comply with editorial policy and use the correct language and pronunciation.  Any required changes are
made by the journalist or editor before they are marked as approved. This gives the scripts a green label in ENPS which
indicates that they can be read on-air.

The newsreader sits in a radio studio and normally has no direct contact with the summaries team. At the time of the
news bulletin, the newsreader reads the news scripts from ENPS live on-air. The audio clips in each script are
automatically loaded into the playout system, and the newsreader triggers them at the correct time.

\subsubsection{Challenges and opportunities}
Finding and cutting clips out of long recordings is a particular challenge.  There is very little information to go on
so users resort to seeking through the recording, listening out for someone's voice or mention of a certain topic.  The
pressure of a fast turn-around makes the situation even more frustrating.  Application of segmentation or
speech-to-text technology could help by indicating where people are speaking, displaying keywords that are mentioned,
or allowing the recording to be searched by text.

When it comes to inserting clips into the script, in and out words are manually entered so that the clip can be
recognised, but there is not enough time to transcribe the whole clip. Speech-to-text technology would be able to
automate this and full transcription could further help the journalists to recall the clip and write the script around
it.

\subsection{Drama}\label{sec:drama}
Radio 4's ``15 Minute Drama'' is a series of original drama and book dramatisations, broadcast twice-daily. Production
of radio drama is radically different from that of news as it is based on a script of a radio play and is created over
a number of weeks.

\subsubsection{Roles}
The production team is made up of five members, plus a cast of actors. The \textit{director} is the owner of the
programme and works with the team to create their interpretation of the radio play. The \textit{broadcast assistant}
handles the administrative side and during the recording, they annotate the script with detailed notes. There are three
\textit{studio managers} (SMs). The \textit{panel SM} leads the recording process and operates the mixing desk.  The
\textit{grams SM}\footnote{`Grams' refers to gramophones, originally the only way to play back sound effects.} makes
the recordings and plays pre-recorded sound effects.  The \textit{spot SM} works in the studio where they place
microphones and create spot effects\footnote{Known as `foley' in the movie industry.}.

\subsubsection{Environment}
The observed drama was recorded in studio 60A, which is a purpose-built flexible performance space at BBC New
Broadcasting House in London. It contains spaces with different acoustic properties including movable absorbers and a
foam-lined spiral corridor, used to simulate distance. There are many fixtures and props for re-creating common
environmental sounds including various doors/windows, a staircase with both wood and carpet, a bedroom and a working
kitchen.

The studio is connected by a large acoustically-isolated window to the cubicle where the production team sit (see
Figure~\ref{fig:drama-studio}). The mixing desk is in front of the window with the broadcast assistant to the right and
the director behind. The grams SM sits at the back of the room, while the spot SM spends most of their time in the
studio.

Post-production is done in an editing suite which is a compact acoustically-treated room with a PC, speakers, small
mixing desk and level meters.

\subsubsection{Workflow}
Prior to the recording, the cast will have done a read-through where the broadcast assistant notes the time taken to
perform each scene.

  \includegraphics[width=2in]{figs/drama-editing-workflow.pdf}
  \caption{Flowchart of drama editing.}
  \label{fig:ethno-drama-recording}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Recording}
The whole team is present during recordings and they normally record at least one episode in a day. The scenes are done
in sequence, with multiple takes recorded for each. When the director is satisfied with the takes, the recording moves
onto the next scene.

During the recording, the panel SM balances the microphone feeds and sound effects, and makes a backup recording onto a
CD. The grams SM records the desk output directly into a digital audio workstation (DAW) and stores each take as a
separate clip. The DAW is used to manually label each clip with the episode, scene and take number (e.g. e2s3t1). The
grams SM also selects and plays environmental recordings and sound effects, which are recorded onto a separate track in
the DAW. The spot SM positions the microphones for the actors and creates live spot effects in the studio. The director
listens carefully to the takes and makes their own notes.  Between takes, they discuss the performance with the team
and give feedback to the actors.

The broadcast assistant takes detailed notes throughout the recording by annotating a paper copy of the script and
keeping a spreadsheet of the takes and their length. The paper annotations (see Figure~\ref{fig:drama-script}) have a
well-defined syntax which is explained below. Although this syntax is widely used, it is not formally defined so can
vary from person-to-person.

A different coloured pen is used for each take. The start and end of each take is marked with a vertical line on the
side of the page, with the take and backup CD numbers written at the top. If the take is repeated within a recording,
the line continues back to the top. Repeated words or phrases are marked with square brackets. If multiple brackets
overlap, their order is labelled with numbers.  Words that are spoken incorrectly are underlined. The best take for
each scene is marked by using highlighter pen on the vertical line for that take.

\begin{figure}[p]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/drama-markup-labelled.pdf}
  \caption{An annotated drama script page. Recordings for each take are marked with different colour lines (1). The best takes are marked with a highlighter pen (2). The backup CD and track number are marked at the top of each line (3) and the length of the take is marked at the bottom (4). Notes are often attached to takes (5). Repeated lines are marked using square brackets in the colour of the take (6). Re-takes are marked differently (7).}
  \label{fig:drama-script}
\end{figure}

After the recording is complete, the audio files are copied onto a portable hard drive. Although hard drives can fail
and be misplaced, they are still used as the computer network is considered too slow and the hard drive can be taken
anywhere.

\paragraph{Rough edit}
The rough edit is created with a DAW by one of the studio managers, usually the panel SM. As the files are stored on a
portable hard drive, this process can be done either in an edit suite or on a laptop at home. The first step is to
create a sequence of the best takes from the recordings. The annotated script is used to identify these, and they are
dragged from the DAW's `clip list' onto a timeline. There can be many clips, so sometimes they are searched with text
to narrow-down the list. Mislabelled clips or misread labels can occasionally cause issues at this stage.

The script is used to identify and remove errors in the takes, particularly re-takes or repeated words. Sometimes these
are missed and must be removed later. The sound level is adjusted to be consistent throughout, either by using the
mouse for in/out fades or by recording automation with a mixing desk slider.

Sound effects that are listed in the script but were not played at the time of recording are added at this stage.
Roughly 900 hours of pre-recorded sound effects are stored on the local computer and their metadata can be searched
using text. It takes skill and experience to know which words to use for the search or to know which CDs or collections
to use for certain effects.

The recordings are listened to so that any unmarked errors are identified, such as noise caused by actors handling the
script during recording. Long sequences are played at double-speed to save time.

\paragraph{Fine edit}\label{sec:drama-fine}
Once the rough edit is complete, the director joins the SM in an edit suite to cut the programme to the correct length,
select the best performances, tweak the sound effects and add background music.

The finished programme must have an exact duration to fill its assigned broadcast slot. Almost always, the programme
will be too long and some lines must be removed. This can only be done by the director as these decisions have a strong
editorial impact.

While listening through the programme, the director may want to compare the chosen take with other takes that were
recorded. To do this, the SM must find the correct recording using their labels, drag it onto the timeline and find the
right position in the recording. This process introduces an overhead which can put directors off comparing performances
too often.

Music is not specified in the script, so the director has the creative freedom to choose what they want. Popular
consumer music services are used to find commercial tracks, but often directors will choose `production music', which
is designed for TV/radio and is easier to license. These are found using one of a number of online music libraries
which, similarly to the sound effects, are searchable using descriptive keywords. The director provides the music to
the SM on a USB storage device for them to insert and mix.

Once finished, the final edit is mixed down to stereo by playing the programme through a digital loop-back. Although
this can be done automatically, it forces the director and SM to listen to the programme from beginning to end in one
go.

\subsubsection{Challenges and opportunities}
The clear syntax used to annotate the drama script shows that the production workflow is well-organised and makes good
use of existing tools. However in the rough edit stage, the SM is performing simple non-creative editing tasks based
purely on the annotations. If these could be captured in a digital format, the rough edit stage could conceivably be
fully or partly automated.

In addition to being script-based, a defining characteristic of drama production is that multiple takes are recorded in
order to capture the best possible performance. However, there is no simple way to directly compare performances so the
director relies heavily on the script annotations and written notes. Providing an easy method of comparing different
takes by ear could potentially lead to selection of better performances.

When actors fluff a line, they often say the line again immediately which is usually noted in the script with square
brackets. However, these can be missed and are not easy to spot in a DAW. Simple audio analysis could be used to detect
and highlight where this happens.

\subsection{Documentary}\label{sec:doc}
``The Report'' is a weekly investigative documentary that covers topical news stories. It is produced over a three week
period by the BBC Current Affairs team and is broadcast at 8pm every Thursday on Radio 4. The team was observed for
four days at various points during the three weeks.

\subsubsection{Roles}
The documentary is created by a core team of three people. The \textit{producer} owns the programme. They decide what
the story-line will be, who to interview and how it is edited. The \textit{researcher} assists the producer with
research and investigation, setting up interviews and transcribing recordings.  Both work full-time on the documentary
throughout the three weeks.  The \textit{presenter} is the narrator for the documentary.  The Report has a regular
presenter who typically works on two or three documentaries at once.

The team is supported by the \textit{editor} who runs the current affairs team.  They provide feedback on the
documentary and must give approval for the documentary to be broadcast. On the final day of production, a
\textit{studio manager} (SM) joins the team to create the final edit.

\subsubsection{Environment}
The team is based in BBC New Broadcasting House in London. Their desks are grouped together in an open-plan office,
beside four studios. The studios are organised into pairs so that one can be used for recordings and the other as a
control room. Each studio is acoustically treated and contains a PC, mixing desk, microphones and a telephone.

\subsubsection{Workflow}
The three weeks it takes to create the programme can be very roughly divided into research, interviews and editing.
However in reality these activities are dependent on external factors and can overlap significantly.


\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{figs/docs-workflow.pdf}
  \caption{Flowchart of documentary production.}
  \label{fig:ethno-drama-recording}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Research}
The purpose of the research stage is to take the idea behind the programme and form an interesting and relevant
storyline around it. Often the topic will be in the news that week, so the producer will be looking for an interesting
angle which can be explored in greater depth.

The research stage does not require any special tools other than a web browser and a telephone. The team will read
around the topic so that they are knowledgeable enough to tell the story well and can identify a number of people they
want to interview. Popular sources of information are previous reports or documentaries, newspaper articles,
encyclopedias and contacts who already know the subject. The producer will make rough notes for themselves in Microsoft
Word and prepare a draft outline of the programme.

\paragraph{Interviews}
Once the team have identified who they would like to interview, they will approach them to see if they are interested.
If the interviewee has the time available, the producer or researcher will do a `pre-interview' over the phone to see
what the person will say and whether it fits the documentary.

Most interviews are done face-to-face, either on-location or in a studio, depending on the situation. A portable audio
recorder and shotgun mic is used for recordings outside of the studio. The presenter holds the microphone and asks the
questions while the producer controls the recorder and the microphone level. Recordings in the studio are made straight
into the \textit{dira!} system using Orion.

If it's not possible to meet face-to-face, interviews can either be done using a local studio and
ISDN\footnote{Integrated Services Digital Network.  A communication standard that can be used to send low-latency
  digital audio over telephone networks.} link, over the phone but with a portable recorder at each end\footnote{Known
  in the business as a `simulrec' or `mic hold'.}, using an IP-based link such as Skype, or just over the phone. The
phone is always a last resort as the quality is very poor.

\paragraph{Rough edit}
When a producer is working on their own, they will usually edit the interviews directly using a DAW. However, when a
team is collaborating with interview material, all of the recordings are first transcribed. Some of this is done using
a third-party transcription service, but the programme's budget can only cover transcription of three or four
interviews. The rest must be transcribed by the team themselves using Microsoft Word. Whereas the professional
transcription service includes every word, the team's own transcriptions will skip out many words, leaving only enough
to get a good idea of what they said.

The transcriptions are printed out on paper and the team works with these printouts until the last few days of
production. Lines from the interviews that they want to use in the programme are marked with highlighter pen. Other
informal notes are made on the paper.

The producer takes the annotated transcriptions and pieces together a rough edit using \textit{dira!} StarTrack. As the
position of each question in the transcription is marked with a timestamp, the producer can narrow-down the location of
the highlighted text in the recording, but only to within a few minutes. For each interview, the producer cuts out and
saves any lines that they have highlighted. These are then sequenced into a rough edit of the programme.

While the producer creates the rough edit, the presenter writes the programme's `links' -- the narrative elements that
join the interview clips. When the first rough edit is complete, the whole team sits down with the editor for a
`run-through'. The programme is performed out loud, straight-through from beginning to end, with the presenter reading
the links and the producer playing the clips. This allows the editor to hear the programme and give feedback early on,
and for the length of the current edit to be determined. This run-through process typically happens two or three times
for each programme.

\paragraph{Fine edit}
The fine edit happens on the day that the programme is to be broadcast. A studio manager (SM) joins the team to create
the final mix. The fine editing requires that the rough edit is transferred into a DAW that has more features than
\textit{dira!} StarTrack.

The SM starts by cleaning up the interview clips. This is done by removing redundant noises (e.g. `umm') and phrases
(e.g. `you know'). Some are left in as they are too difficult to remove or are editorially relevant. Long pauses are
removed to ensure there is a good pace, but are sometimes left in for effect.  The SM also balances the levels by
recording automation using a fader or by dragging in/out fades. 

The links are recorded by the presenter who sits in the studio opposite the SM.  This is done straight into the DAW and
the intro/outro to each clip is played to the presenter. The producer sits in and gives feedback to the presenter over
an intercom. After the links are recorded, the SM goes back to correctly align the interview and link clips in the
timeline.

The Report has theme music which is added at this stage, along with any additional music chosen by the producer.
Similarly to drama (see Section~\ref{sec:drama-fine}), production music is often used and is chosen using an online
library.

Once all of the elements have come together, the producer and SM must cut the programme down to a specific duration (in
this case 27:45). This is done by removing sections of speech that can be cut without impacting on the story.  These
are usually found at the beginning and end of interview clips.

The finished programme is played for the editor who gives their final feedback and approval.  Once signed-off, the
documentary is mixed down to a stereo .wav file and imported into \textit{dira!}. The producer must then listen to the
entire programme in \textit{dira!} to ensure the bit-stream that will be broadcast contains no errors.

\subsubsection{Challenges and opportunities}
The documentary production relies heavily on paper-based transcripts. This allows the team to easily collaborate and to
make notes, but means that there is a disconnect between the words and audio content. This results in wasted time when
the producer has to go back and cut out the selected parts of the interviews. There is also no easy way to listen back
to a line in the transcript. Creating a link between the transcripts and the audio recordings would allow the producers
to work with transcripts as normal, but to simultaneously navigate and edit the audio content.

The fine edit revealed opportunities for assisting the studio manager with the clean-up process. If an acoustic model
of redundant noises and phrases was developed, these could either be highlighted, cut for easy removal or removed
automatically.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:ethno-discussion}
Generally speaking, the study identified a number of opportunities to improve the handling, generation and presentation
of metadata, as discussed below.

\subsection{Text-based working}
The study found that the production teams relied strongly on scripts and transcripts of the audio content. The rough
edits for both the drama and documentary were directly created from annotated scripts of the recordings.  Additionally,
the news summaries team manually annotate their audio clips with in/out words to help them identify the recordings.
These workflows indicates that producers would much rather work with text representations than with audio on a
timeline.

Creating a link between the words in the transcript and their position in the audio could allow the producers to
navigate and edit with text as they prefer, but for the audio to be edited automatically. Hyperaudio \citep{Boas2011}
is an example of a web-based video editor that already uses this approach. In the case of dramas and documentaries, the
full text of the recordings is already available so speech alignment technology such as SailAlign
\citep{Katsamanis2011} could be used instead of full speech-to-text.

\subsection{Use of paper}
Both the drama and documentary teams preferred to work with paper copies of the scripts. Many producers are not
technology-savvy and are therefore much more comfortable with the idea of paper. It also affords them the freedom to
make unstructured notes and easily collaborate face-to-face. However, the use of paper also creates a barrier between
the work done on the page and the work done on the screen. Digital pens and interactive paper are tools that have the
potential to break that barrier while retaining the advantages of both ways of working. Further investigation is needed
to see how such a system could integrate the two approaches and whether the technology is viable.

\subsection{Redundant speech}
Observation of the fine edit in the documentary found that a significant proportion of the studio manager's time was
spent on cleaning-up interview material. Much of this was caused by redundant noises such as `umm's and `err's, or
redundant phrases like `you know'. These could be identified using a system designed or trained for the purpose.
Depending on the producer's confidence in the algorithm, it could either remove the redundant material automatically or
assist the studio manager in identifying and removing the material. 

\subsection{Speaker diarization}
All of the observed productions could benefit from being able to see where different people are speaking in a
recording, known as `speaker diarization'. In drama it would help the producers identify different lines in the script,
in documentaries it would highlight the position of the questions in interview recordings, and in news it would help
producers find what they're looking for more quickly in long off-air recordings. The research around diarization is
fairly mature \citep{AngueraMiro2012} and although it is starting to be used in some experimental BBC services such as
the World Service Archive \citep{Raimond2014}, it has yet to become available any mainstream production tools.

\subsection{Comparing takes}
Drama production is unique in the way it records multiple takes of the same content. This technique allows the
producers to get the most from the actors, but means that it can be difficult to select which performances to use.
Comparing takes during post-production is possible but the process is clumsy.  Providing an easy way to directly
compare performances would allow the director to make a better informed decision on which to use. If the rough edit for
the drama was assembled automatically, comparison could be made easier by aligning the takes on different tracks.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:ethno-conclusion}
An ethnographic study of radio production was conducted by exploring three case studies. It found that producers of
speech radio prefer to work with text-based representations of audio rather than with the recordings directly. Their
workflows are primarily paper-based which creates extra work when moving between paper and audio. Creating a link
between the words on the paper and their location in the audio recordings could significantly improve the production
workflow.

The study also identified opportunities to apply semantic audio technology and interaction design to radio production
tasks. Lots of time is spent cleaning up recordings by removing redundant speech, which could be fully or
semi-automated. Segmenting speech content by speaker would make a positive impact on most speech-based tasks. Finally,
drama productions could benefit from an easy way to compare multiple takes of the same scenes.
