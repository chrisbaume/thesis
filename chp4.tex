\chapter{Audio editing workflows in radio production}\label{chp:ethno}

% link to previous chapter

We saw in Chapter~\ref{chp:colourised} that we can improve the performance of at least one audio editing task by
enhancing the audio visualization. We were interested in exploring how we could apply these techniques to radio
production, to help producers create programmes more efficiently.  To continue this research, we needed to decide which
production tasks we should target. This required an understanding of the tasks involved in radio production, and of the
challenges producers face in their roles.

% radio production is not well documented and hard to access

%Radio production is conducted globally on a large scale. The BBC alone has 9 national and 40 local radio stations,
%%and BBC World Service, which broadcasts in 29 languages. 
%each of which broadcast 24/7.

There are two classic books that document the radio production process. \citet{McLeish2015}, now in its sixth edition,
provides a broad overview of the practice of radio production with an emphasis on editorial, organisational and
business concerns.  \citet{Hausman2012}, currently in its ninth edition, covers the more practical aspects of radio
production including the use and operation of tools and equipment.  Despite the valuable contribution of these
publications, they present a high-level overview of production practice that does not fully address the real-life
challenges and issues that radio producers face in the industry.

It can be difficult for those working outside of the radio industry to learn about the challenges of radio production.
We could only find one published study that involved radio producers, by \citet{Dunaway2000}, which was based on his
experience of being a documentary producer. This lack of studies may be a result of the limited number of radio
producers, and their demanding workload, which can make it challenging to recruit them for research.  For example,
\citet{Kim2003} worked with National Public Radio (NPR) to develop a system for searching speech archives.  Despite
working directly with NPR, they were unsuccessful in recruiting radio producers to evaluate their system as there were
not many producers, and they did not volunteer because they were too busy.

% hard for researchers to develop solutions without understanding challenges and problems
% lots of technology could help, but how to choose which?

There are many semantic audio and user interface technologies that have the potential to improve the radio production
workflow. Speech/music discrimination \citep{Wieser2014}, speaker diarization \citep{AngueraMiro2012}, speaker
identification \citep{Lee1999a} and automatic speech recognition \citep{Junqua1995} can all be beneficial for use in
radio systems \citep{Raimond2014,Bell2015}.  However, without a detailed understanding of the production process, it
can be difficult to know which of these technologies have the most potential, or how they can best be applied to the
workflow.  Additionally, it can be difficult for researchers outside of the industry to contribute developments that
might benefit radio producers without them having a good understanding of the reality of radio production, or the
challenges that producers face.

%Previous studies of professional broadcast environments have focused on how producers collaborate during live
%production \citep{Engstroem2010,Perry2009}, by using video recordings to analyse the interactions between producers.

% what we did in this chapter
To help us better understand the radio production process, we conducted three ethnographic case studies of practice in
BBC Radio.
Section~\ref{sec:ethno-method} outlines the design of our study.
Section~\ref{sec:ethno-results} presents the results of each case studies,
Section~\ref{sec:ethno-discussion} discusses our findings, 
Section~\ref{sec:ethno-conclusion} presents our conclusions, and
Section~\ref{sec:ethno-future} suggests future work.

\section{Methodology}\label{sec:ethno-method}

% objective of study

The objective of our study was to document the radio production workflow, and to identify opportunities for making
improvements through the application of semantic audio technology.

% focus on audio editing
Most radio content is broadcast live. In these cases, the content is produced in real-time, so there is no opportunity
to produce the programme any faster. However, many types of programmes, such as documentaries and drama, are
pre-produced using audio editing software. Here, the production process is many times longer than the programme, so
there are opportunities to make the production process more efficient.  For this reason, we chose to focus on studying
the production of pre-produced radio programmes.

\subsection{Data collection}
% ethnography, direct observation
We used ethnographic research methods to study the culture of radio production in BBC Radio. We chose to use direct
observation to collect our data, where we witnessed production first-hand without taking part.  We did this because
producers are very busy and direct observation allowed us to unobtrusively collect the data without adding to the
producer's workload. Additionally we could observe the real-world process, as opposed to a theoretical one, and take
into account the context of the working environment.

We recorded the data by writing field notes during observation. We were not able to use video or audio recording as
much of the observation took place in open-plan offices that deal with sensitive information. In addition to the
observation, we used time between activities to ask the participants clarifying questions.

% sampling
Due to the scale and variety of the radio operations at the BBC, it would be impossible to cover all production genres
and techniques. To limit the scope of our work, we followed a ``maximum variation sampling'' strategy \citep[p.
172]{Patton1990} to choose a small number of heterogeneous case studies. We aimed to select programmes of different
genres to cover a variety of cultures and work practices.

The time needed to produce programmes can vary significantly, with some being produced over many weeks or months. To
reduce our observation time, we worked with the producer of each programme to create a schedule of observations that
sampled every stage of the process. This allowed us to capture the entire workflow without having to be present
throughout.

% recruitment
\subsection{Recruitment}
We recruited participants using an invitation email sent to BBC R\&D's contact list of studio managers working in BBC
Radio. Through this process, we recruited three producers who worked on the programmes and in the departments listed
below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Hourly news bulletin (Radio Summaries, BBC News)
	\item ``15 Minute Drama'' radio drama (London Radio Drama, BBC Radio)
	\item ``The Report'' documentary (Radio Current Affairs, BBC News)
\end{itemize}

These three programmes (news report, drama, documentary) fulfilled our criteria for a heterogeneous sample of
programmes from different genres.

% data collection
\subsection{Procedure}
We used a single researcher to collect the data for our study through direct observation. The researcher observed the
production of each programme from the beginning of audio recording/collection, to the point where the audio had been
finalised. The observation did not focus on a single member of the team, but covered the entire team that
contributed to the audio production. This allowed us to study the different roles involved  and how they interact.  The
production teams were observed in their normal place of work. This allowed us to take into account the context of the
environment in which the teams work, both in terms of the physical location and layout, and of the tools and software
they use to perform their tasks.

We worked with the producer of each programme to design a schedule of observation that would cover the entire
production process. Each programme required a different amount of time. Observing the news bulletin took half-a-day,
the drama took two days, and the documentary took four days. 

The researcher used a laptop to type field notes throughout the observation. When the team members were
not busy, the researcher asked clarifying questions to ensure they understood the reasons and motivation behind their
actions. The notes specifically included the following:

{\singlespacing
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Roles} -- Who are the teams members? What are their responsibilities? Which other teams are involved?
	\item \textbf{Environment} -- What is the location? How is the physical space laid out?
	\item \textbf{Tools} -- Which tools are used? For what purpose? How do the users operate them?
	\item \textbf{Tasks} -- What tasks are involved? Who does what? What sequence do they take place?
	\item \textbf{Challenges} -- Were there any problems or frustrations? Which activities were demanding or mundane?
\end{itemize}
}

The researcher also took photographs of any relevant locations, tools or other items, with the permission of the
participant.

\subsection{Analysis}

We populated a list of roles involved in the production and wrote a description of each of their responsibilities. We
wrote a description of the working environment in which the production took place, including the location, the tools
that were used, and how they were used. We also drew a map of the physical environment, including the spatial layout of
the team members.

We used hierarchical task analysis \citep{Kirwan1992,Annett2000} to deconstruct the production process into a sequence
of individual tasks. We assigned each task to the role that was responsible and the location in which it took
place. We then used a partitioned operational sequence diagram \citep{Kirwan1992} to graph the sequence of tasks from
top to bottom, arranged into columns to indicate the role and location.

Finally, we identified any challenges that were noted by the researcher, and wrote a description of the current
approach and any suggested improvements that could be made.

\section{Study results}\label{sec:ethno-results}

In this section, we present the results of our three ethnographic case studies. For each study, we describe the roles
and responsibilities of the team members, the environment and tools that were used, the results of the task analysis we
performed, and list the challenges we identified.

%The vast majority of radio production work in the BBC uses a networked audio production system called \textit{dira!}
%\citep{SCISYS2015}. It is colloquially known as `VCS', after the former name of the company that makes it. All audio
%content is kept on distributed storage and the system is accessed using various pieces of software: `StarTrack' is a
%multi-track audio editor, `Orion' is an audio recorder and single-track editor and `Highlander' is used to browse
%recordings and metadata. 

\subsection{News bulletin}\label{sec:news}
The Radio Summaries team at BBC News (known as ``summaries'') write the hourly news bulletins for most of the national
radio networks. The 6pm and 10pm bulletins are handled by different teams, as are the bulletins for Radio 1, 1Xtra,
Asian Network and Radio 5.  The bulletins written by the team are read live on-air by a newsreader at the start of
every hour.

The researcher observed the team for five hours during a morning weekday shift, from 7am to midday. The pace of work in
the team was so fast that there was little time to talk to the participants to ask any questions, so the results are
mostly based on direct observation.

\subsubsection{Roles and responsibilities}\label{sec:news-roles}
Summaries is run by an \textit{assistant editor} who leads between two and four \textit{broadcast journalists}. The
team work 24 hours a day on three eight-hour rolling shifts to report breaking news stories and their developments
throughout the day.

The role of each broadcast journalist is to select and write a series of short text summaries of the day's news stories
for a given radio network.  They enhance the summaries by finding, editing and inserting audio clips of reports
or interviews.  Broadcast journalists produce one bulletin per hour, each between two and five minutes long, with between
four and six stories per bulletin.  The length of the bulletin and number of stories depend on the network and the time
of day. For example, Radio 4 bulletins are longer than other networks, and midday bulletins are longer than those at
other times. Even if the stories being covered are the same, the bulletins for each network are written separately so
that they are targeted to the audience of that network.  This is done by varying the language, tone, amount of detail
and level of assumed knowledge.

The assistant editor is the team leader, but also performs the same role as the broadcast journalists. They assign the
responsibility for each radio network to a broadcast journalist. Throughout the day, they keep track of the news
stories that are developing and decide which of these should be included in the bulletins. Sometimes they will
commission a reporter to record a news report to include in the bulletins. The assistant editor reads and approves each
bulletin written by the team to check that they are appropriately worded, have been fact-checked, and comply with the
BBC's editorial guidelines.  The assistant editor aims to have the bulletins approved about 15 mins before the hour,
but often new developments mean that bulletins are being edited at the last minute.  Once approved, the finished
bulletins are read out live by a \textit{newsreader} in a radio studio, who generally has no direct contact with the
rest of the team.

The summaries team gather audio content by working with the Intake team and directly with reporters. The
`\textit{Intake}' team set up and record live incoming audio and video feeds from reporters in the field. They use an
intercom to notify summaries of the incoming feeds so that they can listen-in to the live feeds and provide instant
feedback to the reporter.  Summaries also work directly with individual reporters that have been commissioned to record
clips for the bulletins. These are recorded and edited by the reporters themselves and provided to the team directly.

\subsubsection{Environment and tools}
The summaries team sit together on a single desk in the BBC newsroom at New Broadcasting House in London.
Figure~\ref{fig:newsroom} shows the newsroom and Figure~\ref{fig:newsroom-layout} shows the location of the team within
the space. The BBC newsroom houses teams from around the BBC News division and is spatially arranged to facilitate the
fast flow of communication. The teams for each platform (e.g. TV, radio, online) sit together on desks that fan out
from a central area. Decisions on which stories to cover are made in this central area, and are communicated outwards.

Figure~\ref{fig:news-desktop} shows an example of the desks used by members of the radio summaries team. The desk
includes an intercom that can be used to communicate with other teams using labelled ``push-to-talk'' buttons. A
desktop TV monitor is used to keep an eye on the 24-hour BBC News television channel, to track which stories they are
currently reporting. Most communication is within the team, which is helped by sitting close together on the same desk.

  \label{fig:news-enps-edit}
\end{figure}

The broadcast journalists and assistant editor write the summaries on a desktop PC using a software package called
``Electronic News Production System'' (\textit{ENPS}). Figure~\ref{fig:news-enps-edit} shows the ENPS interface. ENPS
is used for writing scripts, compiling and approving news bulletins, and monitoring newswire services\footnote{Newswire
services are global news agencies that provide news reports to subscribing news organisations, such as Reuters and
Associated Press (AP).}. The system is networked so that any changes made in ENPS are instantaneously updated for
everybody. Audio clips are browsed, imported and edited using a plugin called Media Object Server (\textit{MOS}), which
integrates with the \textit{dira!} radio production system.

  \label{fig:news-arrivals}
\end{figure}

When Intake upload a clip to \textit{dira!}, it appears on a large screen in the news floor called the ``arrivals
board'' (see Figure~\ref{fig:news-arrivals}). The display includes a reference number which can be used to find the
clip, as well as the upload time and a description. The description often contains the subject, reporter's name and
their location, but the descriptions are written quickly and their is no formal syntax.

\end{figure}

% read newswires
% monitor TV news
% select stories
% commission reporter
% write summary
The assistant editor selects which news stories should be included in the bulletins. The stories come from multiple
sources, including newswire services and the BBC television news channel.
Newswire
reports are accessed through ENPS, and users are notified of any reports flagged as important.  As they work, the
assistant editor and broadcast journalists use their desktop monitor to keep an eye on the BBC News TV channel to spot
any breaking news stories, or material which they could use in their bulletins, such as interviews.  The assistant
editor will sometimes commission a reporter to record a news report for a particular story to ensure that they have
good audio content to include in the summary. The broadcast journalists and assistant editor both write the
summaries for a specific bulletin using ENPS. Previously-written summaries are often re-used, but are updated to
reflect the latest information.

% receive audio from reporter
% receive audio from intake
% monitor TV news
% clip audio
% insert audio
Audio clips are added to each summary to include quotes from interviews and items from reporters. The audio is sourced
from the Intake team, directly from reporters and from the BBC News TV channel. Audio from Intake and reporters is
imported using the \textit{MOS} plugin. The plugin allows users to find audio in the \textit{dira!} radio production system
and edit clips by cutting the audio, and controlling sound levels/fading. Finished clips are inserted directly into the
text of the written summary using a drag-and-drop gesture. At this point, the broadcast journalist gives the clip a
name and can optionally include the ``in/out words'' that are spoken at the start and end of the clip.  The name,
in/out words and duration of the clip appear in the script.  Audio from the BBC News TV channel must be found and
clipped by the broadcast journalist themselves. The sound from the television channel is automatically recorded into
\textit{dira!} in 40-minute segments. The broadcast journalist uses the \textit{MOS} plugin to browse to the desired
segment, find the location of the audio they want, and create a clip of the audio.

% edit to time
% submit for approval
% provide feedback
% make corrections
% read bulletin on-air
The finished bulletin must fit an exact time slot (e.g. 120 seconds), so the broadcast journalist must estimate how
long it takes to read their bulletin, including the audio clips, and edit the text to the correct length.  When a
journalist has finished writing their bulletin, it is placed into the `running order' and named according to the
network and time (e.g. `R4 Thu 10:00').  The assistant editor then reviews the bulletin and listens to the clips. This
is to ensure the bulletin is of the right length, is factually accurate, uses the correct language, and complies with
BBC editorial policy. Any required changes are made either by giving feedback to the journalist, or by the assistant
editor making the changes themselves.  When the item is approved in ENPS, it is labelled with a green flag, which
indicates that it has been signed-off.

The newsreader sits in a radio studio and normally has no direct contact with the summaries team.  At the time of the
news bulletin, the newsreader reads the script directly from ENPS while on-air. The audio clips in the script are
automatically loaded into the play-out system, and the newsreader uses a button to trigger them at the right time.  The
duration and in/out words of the audio clip are displayed in the script, which helps the newsreader to predict when the
clip ends.

\subsubsection{Challenges}

The summaries team work under high-pressure circumstances. They have less than an hour to put together several minutes
of content that will be read to millions of listeners. News can break at any moment, so sometimes bulletins need to be
changed or re-written minutes before they are broadcast. In addition to these pressures, it is very important that the
news reports are factually accurate and balanced.  Due to these circumstances, the participants had very little time to
talk to the researcher. During observation, all of the communication between team members was directly related to the
task at hand, and there was no chatting or socialising.

When creating clips from television broadcasts, the journalists must source the clips from 40-minute-long
segments.  To find the audio, they seeked through the recording and listened for a particular voice or mention of the
topic of interest.  The \textit{MOS} plugin interface they used displayed a waveform, but this did not seem to help
them find the audio.  Finding and cutting clips in this way is a time-consuming and difficult task, particularly when
performed under pressure.  Application of segmentation or speech-to-text technology could help by indicating where
people are speaking, displaying keywords that are mentioned, or allowing the recording to be searched by text.

The bulletins written by the broadcast journalists must target a specific duration for when they are read.  They have
no indication of how long it takes to read a piece of text. They must therefore estimate this based on experience, or
reading it in their head.  By developing a system that estimates the duration of spoken text, broadcast journalists may
be able to target a specific duration more efficiently. 

When it comes to inserting clips into the script, in and out words must be manually entered so that the clip can be
recognised in the text. Ideally this text would include a full transcription, but there is not enough time to
transcribe the whole clip.  Speech-to-text technology could be used to help automate this and full transcription could
further help the journalists to recall the clip and write the script around it.

\subsection{Drama}\label{sec:drama}
Radio 4's ``15 Minute Drama'' is a series of original drama and book dramatisations, broadcast twice-daily. Drama
production is very different from most other genres in radio, as it is based on a pre-written script of a radio play.
Each episode takes around two days to produce, but production of the series spans several weeks.  The researcher
observed the production over two full days -- one for the recording of the drama and the other for the editing process.
The observation did not include the writing of the script.

\subsubsection{Roles and responsibilities}
The production team is led by a \textit{director} who works with a \textit{broadcast assistant} and three studio
managers (SMs) -- a \textit{panel SM}, \textit{grams SM} and \textit{spot SM}. The team record a \textit{cast} of
actors who perform the drama.

The director is responsible for leading the team and making editorial and creative decisions. Before the recording,
they will have commissioned a writer to create the script, and worked with them to refine it. During the recording,
they announce the start and end of takes, give feedback to the cast about their performances, and work with
the SMs to ensure the drama has the right sound.

The director is supported by a broadcast assistant who handles much of the administrative work before and after the
recording, such as making copies of the script, booking the cast, producers and rooms, and processing payments.
During the recording, they annotate the script with detailed notes about the position and length of each take, and mark
any mistakes or re-takes.

The panel SM is responsible for the sound of the drama. They lead the other two SMs during the recording process,
operate the mixing desk in the cubicle and make backup recordings of the performances onto CDs.  They also work with
the spot SM to position the actors and microphones to achieve they sound they want.  After the recording, they work
with the director to edit the drama into the final version.

The grams SM prepares and plays pre-recorded sound effects during the recording, and is also responsible for recording
the performances using a DAW.  ``Grams'' refers to gramophones, which were historically used to play pre-recorded sound
effects.  After each take, the grams SM labels the recording with the episode, scene and take numbers, which are later
used to assemble the final programme.  When the director wants to listen back to a performance, the grams SM uses the
DAW to find and replay the desired take.

The spot SM works in the studio, where they set up and position microphones and create spot
effects, also known as ``foley'' in the film industry. The effects are produced using a large variety of props that
are kept in the studio to emulate common sounds such as doors, windows, locks, telephones and footsteps to name a few.

The cast are hired by the director specifically for the drama being recorded. Often the cast are sourced from the BBC
Radio Drama Company (RDC), which is a rotating group of actors that are employed by the BBC. The cast perform the
radio play in the studio, working under instruction from the director.

\subsubsection{Environment and tools}
The drama we observed was recorded in Studio 60A, which is a purpose-built flexible performance space at BBC New
Broadcasting House in London. The studio contains various spaces with different acoustic properties, including a
staircase with wood, concrete and carpet steps, an upstairs bedroom, a fully working kitchen and a foam-lined spiral
corridor, used to simulate distance.  There are many fixtures and a range of props for re-creating spot effects of
common environmental sounds such as freestanding doors/windows with a variety of knockers and letter boxes. The studio
is a large space, so there are four CCTV cameras which are used to help the producers in the cubicle to see parts of
the studio that are out of view. 

The studio is connected by a large acoustically-isolated window to the control room, known as the ``cubicle'', where
the production team sit.  Figure~\ref{fig:drama-studio} shows the view of the studio from the cubicle, and
Figure~\ref{fig:drama-layout} shows the layout of the two spaces. The mixing desk is operated by the panel SM and is
positioned directly in front of the window.  The broadcast assistant sits to the right of the panel SM and the director
sits directly behind them. The grams SM sits at the back of the room, while the spot SM spends most of their time in
the studio.  The director, broadcast assistant and panel SM each have an intercom, which they can use to communicate
with people in the studio with a ``push-to-talk'' button.

The panel SM sets the sound levels and balances the audio using the mixing desk, and makes a backup recording of the
performances using a CD recorder located in a rack to the left of the mixing desk.  Under the mixing desk, there is a
foot pedal which controls a light in the studio to silently indicate the start of a performance, known as a ``cue
light''. The panel SM also controls warning lights displayed above the door to the studio to stop people from walking
in during recording.  The grams SM uses software called ``SpotOn'' to select and play pre-recorded sound effects. They
use the ProTools DAW to record audio clips of each performance, and label them with the episode, scene and take numbers.

Figure~\ref{fig:drama-edit} shows the editing suite where the panel SM and director perform the post-production work.
The editing suite is a compact acoustically-treated room which houses a PC running ProTools, stereo speakers, a small
mixing desk and level meters.  The left monitor is used to find pre-recorded sound effects and the right monitor is
used to arrange and edit the audio clips. The panel SM uses an annotated copy of the script to guide this process.

radio drama recording and editing processes, respectively. Descriptions of each workflow are presented individually
below.

  \label{fig:ethno-drama-recording}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Recording}
The recording process involves the entire production team and cast. Between one and two episodes are recorded in a day.
Prior to recording, the cast will assemble in the ``green room'' with the director and rehearse the play. During the
rehearsal, the broadcast assistant measures how long the performances take, to ensure they are not too long or too
short.  The director provides feedback to the cast on their performances before they move to the studio.

The drama is recorded as a series of ``takes''. Each take is a short segment of a scene, often only
20--30 seconds long.  Multiple takes of the same material are recorded so that the director can give feedback to the
cast between takes.  The director starts the recording process by announcing the episode, scene and take number.  The
panel SM starts the backup recording, and the grams SM starts the DAW recording. When everything is ready, the panel SM
flashes the cue light, which silently signals the cast to start performing.  During each take, everybody listens to the
performance. The panel SM balances the audio levels, the grams SM triggers pre-recorded sound effects, and the spot SM
performs live spot effects in the studio.

The broadcast assistant annotates a printed script with information about each take.  Figure~\ref{fig:drama-script}
shows an example of an annotated drama script.  The start and end of each take is marked with a vertical line on the
side of the page. The take and backup CD numbers are written at the top of each line, and the duration of the take is
written at the bottom.  If the take starts again during a recording, the line continues back to the top.  The best take
for each scene is marked by highlighting the line for that take.  Words that are spoken incorrectly are underlined, and
repeated words or phrases are marked with square brackets.  Different coloured pens are used to distinguish the marks
for each take.

    to takes (5). Repeated lines are marked using square brackets in the colour of the take (6).}

\end{figure}

At the end of a take, the DAW and backup recordings are stopped. The grams SM uses the DAW to label the clip with the
episode, scene and take number (e.g. ``e2s3t1''). The broadcast assistant marks the printed script and spreadsheet with
the duration of the take and the backup CD number.  If the director wants to record another take, they discuss the
performance with the production team, then provide the cast with feedback, either by walking into the studio, or using
the intercom.  If the director is satisfied that they have recorded what they need, then they select the best take and
move onto the next scene. The broadcast assistant marks the best take on the script and spreadsheet, which calculates
the current overall duration of the recording.

At the end of the episode, the team either move on to the next episode, or the director sends everybody home.  The
grams SM copies the audio clips from the DAW onto a portable hard drive.  Portable hard drives are used as they can
handle large file sizes better than than the local computer network.  The hard drive and annotated drama
script are given to the panel SM to use for editing.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Editing}
The recordings for the drama are edited into a final programme by the panel SM and director. The panel SM starts by
creating a rough edit of the programme by themself, using the annotated script as a guide.  As the files are stored
on a portable hard drive, this process can be done either in an edit suite or on a laptop at home. The first step is to
create a sequence of the best takes from the recordings, as marked in the annotated script, by dragging them onto a
time-line from the list of labelled clips.  The panel SM uses the script to identify and remove errors in the takes,
such as re-takes or repeated words.  They adjust the sound level to be consistent throughout by using the mouse
to draw level curves, or by recording automation using a fader on the mixing desk.

The panel SM adds any additional sound effects using an effects library on their PC, which contains roughly 900 hours
of sound effects.  The effects are found either by using text to search their metadata, or by browsing to specific
collections of effects.  Before the director joins them, the panel SM listens through the rough edit to identify any
mistakes or errors, such as repeated words and phrases, or noise caused by actors handling their paper scripts.
Double-speed playback is used to save time during this process.

Once the rough edit is complete, the director joins the panel SM in the edit suite. They listen to the rough edit
to judge the quality of the performances they previously selected as the best takes.  Often, the director will ask the
panel SM to play other takes so that they can compare them.  To do this, the SM finds the correct recording in the clip
list, drags it onto the time-line and finds the correct position in the clip.  The director may ask the panel SM to swap
a take, or combine the start and end of different takes to use the best performances.  The same process happens for the
sound effects, which may be swapped or mixed together.

Music is not specified in the script, so the director has the freedom to choose what they want. Popular consumer music
services such as iTunes are used to find commercial tracks, but often directors will choose ``production music'', which
is designed for TV/radio and is easier to license. These can be searched using descriptive keywords on one of a
number of online music libraries such as Audio Network or Desktop Jukebox.  The director provides the music to the
panel SM on a USB storage device for them to add using the DAW.

The final programme must have an exact duration to fit its assigned broadcast slot. The programme is often edited to be
slightly too long, so some lines can be removed to reduce the programme length. Removing lines has a strong
editorial impact, so the director decides which lines to remove and the panel SM edits them out using the DAW.  Once
finished, the final edit is rendered to an audio file by playing the programme in real-time through a digital
loop-back. Although this can be done faster, this playback forces the director and panel SM to listen to the programme
from beginning to end in one go. If they are happy with the edit, the director sends the file to their editor for
sign-off and broadcast.

\subsubsection{Challenges}
The clear syntax used to annotate the drama script shows that the production workflow is well-organised and makes good
use of existing tools. However to convert those annotations into a rough edit, the SM must use a DAW to manually
arrange and edit the clips, and remove any marked errors. This can be a lengthy and tedious process. If the annotations
could be captured digitally, the rough edit stage could conceivably be fully or partly automated.

In addition to being script-based, a defining characteristic of drama production is that multiple takes are recorded in
order to capture the best possible performance. However, there is no simple way to directly compare performances. For
this reason, the director does not want to compare too many takes, and therefore relies heavily on the script
annotations and written notes. Providing a quick and easy method for the director to listen to and compare different
takes could potentially lead to selection of better performances.

When actors make a mistake, they often say the line again immediately. This is usually marked in the script with square
brackets. However, these can sometimes be missed and are not easy to spot using the DAW interface.  Audio analysis
techniques could be used to detect and highlight where this happens.

\subsection{Documentary}\label{sec:doc}
``The Report'' is a weekly investigative documentary that covers topical news stories. It is produced over a three week
period by the Radio Current Affairs department in BBC News and is broadcast at 8pm every Thursday on Radio 4. The
researcher observed the team for a total of four days -- one day during their research phase, one day during their
interviewing phase and two days during their editing phase.

\subsubsection{Roles and responsibilities}
The documentary is created by a team of three, made up of a \textit{producer}, \textit{presenter} and
\textit{researcher}.  At certain points during the production, the team is supported by an \textit{editor} and
a \textit{studio manager}.

The producer leads the team and makes the editorial decisions. They decide what the story-line will be, who to interview
and how the programme is edited together. They pre-interview participants to screen them, record interviews with
them, transcribe those recordings and create a rough edit of the programme.

The \textit{presenter} is a journalist who is the narrator of the documentary. They work closely with the producer to
craft the story-line, write the narrative ``links'', conduct interviews and provide feedback to the producer about the
edit. The Report has a regular presenter who typically works on two or three documentaries at once.

The \textit{researcher} assists the producer with research and investigation. They recruit for and set up interviews,
conduct pre-interviews, and transcribe audio. 

The \textit{editor} leads the Radio Current Affairs department. They do not participate directly in the production of
the documentary, but provide feedback to the team and give approval for the documentary to be broadcast.

A \textit{studio manager} (SM) joins the team on the final day of production to turn the producer's rough edit into
the finished programme. This process includes recording the presenter, removing redundant speech, adjusting the pace of
the speech, removing unwanted noise and adding music.

\subsubsection{Environment and tools}
The team is based in BBC New Broadcasting House in London. Most of the work takes place in an open-plan office using
standard office desks with just a PC and telephone. The research for the programme is desk-based and does not require
any special tools other than a web browser and phone.

Face-to-face interviews are conducted either on-location, in the office building or in a radio studio.  For interviews
outside the studio, a portable audio recorder and microphone are used to capture the audio.  Remote interviews are
conducted by using a digital ``ISDN''\footnote{Integrated Services Digital Network} link to a local radio studio, an
IP-based call such as Skype, or over the telephone. The telephone is used as a last resort as it has the poorest sound
quality.

The office is located directly beside four radio studios. The studios are organised into pairs so that one can be used
for recordings, with the other used as a cubicle. Each studio is acoustically treated and contains a PC with a DAW,
a mixing desk, speakers, microphones and a telephone connected to a recorder. The studio is used to record remote and
face-to-face interviews, record the presenter's narration, listen to the programme and edit it into the final
version.

\subsubsection{Task analysis}
Figure~\ref{fig:ethno-docs-workflow} shows the operational sequence diagram of the documentary production.  A
description of the workflow is presented below.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{figs/docs-workflow.pdf}
  \caption{Operational sequence diagram of radio documentary production, partitioned by role and location.\\
  {\footnotesize ($^{*}$some interviews are transcribed using a third-party service)}}
  \label{fig:ethno-docs-workflow}
\end{figure}

Production starts with researching the chosen topic of the documentary.  The purpose of the research stage is to form
the story-line for the documentary, and to identify people to interview.  Often the topic will be in the news that week
and the producer will be looking for an interesting angle which can be explored in greater depth.  The producer and
researcher listen to news reports and documentaries, read newspaper articles and encyclopedias, and talk to contacts
who know about the subject.  The producer makes rough notes for themselves in Microsoft Word and prepares a draft
outline of the programme.

Once the team have identified who they might want to interview, the producer or researcher will approach them to see if
they are interested.  If the interviewee has the time available, the producer or researcher will do a `pre-interview'
over the phone, which simulates a real interview but is not recorded. This is done to see what the person will say and
whether it suits the story-line of the documentary.  Most interviews are recorded face-to-face, either on-location or in
a studio, depending on the situation.  During interviews, the presenter asks the questions while the producer records
the audio and monitors the levels.  For on-location interviews, the presenter holds the microphone and the producer
operates the portable recorder.

All of the interview recordings are transcribed. Some recordings are sent to a third-party transcription service in
Australia that transcribes the audio overnight.  However, often the programme's budget can only cover transcription of
less than half of the interviews. The rest must be transcribed by the producer or researcher. For this, they use
Microsoft Word to manually type the words.  To save time, they will only do a rough transcription by skipping most
words, leaving only enough to get a good idea of what was said.  With both the third-party and manual transcriptions,
timestamps are written every few minutes to help the reader identify the location of the audio.

The interview transcripts are printed onto paper, which the team use to help them collaborate face-to-face.  The team
go through the interview transcripts and mark lines that they want to use with a highlighter pen. Notes and labels are
informally written on the page.  After the team have marked-up the interview transcripts, the producer uses them as a
guide to find the audio of the content they highlighted, and piece it together into a rough edit using a DAW. The
timestamps written in the transcript are used to help them navigate the audio.

While the producer creates a rough edit, the presenter writes the programme's ``links'' -- the narrative elements that
sit between the interview clips. When the first rough edit is complete, the whole team sits down with the editor for a
``run-through''. The programme is performed out loud from beginning to end, with the presenter reading the links and
the producer playing the clips from the DAW. This allows the editor to hear the programme and give early feedback. It
also allows the producer to determine the current length of the programme.  This run-through process typically happens
two or three times for each programme.

Once the editor is happy with the rough edit, a studio manager (SM) is brought it to help turn it into the final
programme.  This often happens on the day of the broadcast.  The SM records the presenter's links directly into the
DAW, while the producer gives feedback to the presenter.  The programme's theme music is added, along with any
additional music chosen by the producer, which is often production music sourced from an online library.  The SM cleans
up the interview clips by removing redundant noises (e.g. ``umm'') and phrases (e.g. ``you know''), and ensures a good
pace by removing long pauses. However, some redundant noises or pauses are left in because they are difficult to remove
or editorially relevant.  The SM also balances the sound levels by recording automation using a fader on the mixing
desk or by dragging in/out fades. 

Once all of the elements have come together, the producer and SM work together to cut the programme down to a specific
duration (in this case 27 minutes and 45 seconds). This is done by removing sections of speech, usually from the
beginning and end of interview clips.  The finished programme is played to the editor who gives their final feedback.
Once any changes are made and the programme is signed-off, the documentary is rendered to an audio file and imported
into the \textit{dira!} radio production system. The producer must then listen to the entire programme in
\textit{dira!} to ensure the audio that will be broadcast contains no errors.

\subsubsection{Challenges and opportunities}
The documentary production relies heavily on printed transcripts, which allow the team to collaborate and make notes.
However, transcription is expensive if done using a third-party, and time-consuming if done by the team.  Transcripts
can give an idea of what was said, but it is difficult to navigate the audio to listen to how it was said.  After the
transcripts are annotated, the producer has to go back and manually edit the selected parts of the interviews, which is
a slow and tedious process.  Creating a link between the printed transcripts and the audio recordings would allow the
producers to work with transcripts as normal, but to simultaneously navigate and edit the audio content.

The studio manager used a DAW to manually remove redundant noises such as ``umm''s.  Finding and removing these noises
is slow and difficult. If an acoustic model of redundant noises and phrases could be developed, these could either be
highlighted for easier identification, or removed automatically.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:ethno-discussion}
Our study investigated audio editing workflows in radio production using three ethnographic case studies. We identified
three themes from the results of the study with regard to textual representation, the use of paper and disconnection
from the audio. We discuss each of these themes below.

\subsection{Textual representation}
We observed that in all three case studies, the producers interacted with audio using a textual representation. A
script was used to refer to and mark-up the audio recorded in the drama. The documentary producers transcribed all of
their interview recordings, and used the transcripts for most of the production. The news bulletin producers also used
text to label and insert ``out-words'' of the audio clips in their scripts.

Sound is a medium that must be experienced over a period of time, so listening to large quantities of audio can be
slow. Representing audio using text allows users to quickly glance through and search audio content without having to
invest time in listening. Text can be used to display word-for-word what was said, but it cannot display how it was
said. The nuances the spoken word can contain deeper meaning, which may not be visible in a written
transcript. Despite this, the documentary producers we observed chose to work with text rather than directly with the
audio, which demonstrated that they found value in using a textual representation.

Generating transcripts of speech can be an expensive process. We saw that the documentary producers could only afford
to transcribe less than half of their interviews, so had to transcribe the rest themselves, which took a long time and
produced poor quality results.  Automatic speech recognition \citep{Lee1999a} could make this process faster
and more affordable. However, automatically-generated transcriptions contain errors that may affect the usability of
such transcripts in a radio production environment.

\subsection{Use of paper}
We saw that in both the drama and documentary productions, the teams used printed scripts or transcripts as part of
their workflow. The two reasons we could identify for using paper rather than a screen interface were to make
handwritten annotations, and to facilitate face-to-face collaboration.  The drama production team used scripts to help
them coordinate what they were recording, and to make annotations that were later used as a guide to edit the
programme. The documentary producers printed the transcripts of their recordings to help them collaborate face-to-face
in deciding which parts to use, then marking their selections using a highlighter pen.

Paper is a flexible medium, which can be handed around, pointed at and annotated freely, amongst other things.
However, with both the documentary and drama, the annotations made on the page were used as instructions on how to edit
the audio, which had to be done manually using a DAW. This is a tedious and slow process. If these annotations could be
captured in a structured digital format, they could then be automatically translated into audio edit commands. This may
save producers time and effort without deviating much from their existing workflow.

\subsection{Disconnection from audio}
In all of the case studies we observed, there was a disconnection between the medium the producers use to represent the
content and the audio. In the documentary production, the audio was represented using printed transcripts. Timestamps
were written in the transcript every few minutes to help producers locate the original audio, but some searching was
required to find and listen to the desired words.  In the drama production, scripts were used to refer to the audio
content. Each take was labelled with its episode, scene and take number. However, comparing multiple takes was a
process of manually importing and aligning the desired clips.  News bulletins are written as text, but designed to be
spoken aloud. Estimating the time it takes to speak the words required the journalist to either read the words in their
head, or estimate the time based on experience.

This disconnection from the audio means that often producers are making decisions based on an abstract representation of
the sound, such as text. The producers we observed used timestamps and labels to link to the audio, but
these links had a low precision and only reduced the area in which the producer had to search to listen to the audio.
Creating a more direct link from the text to the audio would allow producers to listen to the audio with greater
precision and efficiency. For example, if each word was labelled with a precise timestamp, an audio playback device
could instantly seek to that exact moment in the recording. More direct access to audio content
could allow producers to make better decisions on what content to include in their programme.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:ethno-conclusion}
We investigated audio editing workflows in radio production by conducting three ethnographic case studies in BBC
Radio. The case studies covered production of a news bulletin, a drama and a documentary.  Through direct observation,
we documented the roles, responsibilities, environment, tools and challenges of each production, and used task analysis
to deconstruct and graph the tasks of each programme's workflow.

We saw that radio producers often work with textual representations of audio, rather than with the audio recordings
directly, to help them search and navigate content more efficiently.  The drama and documentary producers used paper
scripts to make freehand annotations and facilitate face-to-face collaboration. We also observed that there was a
disconnection between these abstract representations that were used and the audio content itself, which could lead to
decisions being made without listening to the audio.  We identified opportunities to assist the challenges of radio
production using automated speech recognition, digitisation of paper annotations and creating more direct links to
audio content.

\section{Future work}\label{sec:ethno-future}
During our study, we identified further opportunities for improving the radio production workflow through the
application of de-umming, speaker diarization and comparison of similar content. We explain each of these below.

In our observation of documentary editing process, we saw that a large proportion of the studio manager's time was
spent on cleaning-up interview material, known as ``de-umming''. Much of this was to remove redundant noises such as
``umm''s and ``err''s, or redundant phrases such as ``you know''. These could be identified using a system designed or
trained to identify these noises.  Depending on the producer's confidence in the system, they could either remove
the noises themselves, or let the system remove them automatically.

All of productions we observed may benefit from being able to see where different people are speaking in a recording,
known as ``speaker diarization''. In drama, it could help producers identify different lines in the script, in
documentaries it could highlight the position of the questions in interview recordings, and in news it could help
producers navigate long off-air recordings. There is an existing body of work on speaker diarization
\citep{AngueraMiro2012} that has been used to help users navigate radio archives \citep{Raimond2014}, but could also be
used in the production process.

Drama production involves recording multiple takes of the same content. This technique allows producers to get the most
from the actors, but means that it can be difficult to select which performances to use.  Comparing takes during
post-production is a manual and inefficient process.  Providing an easy way to directly compare performances could
allow the director to make a better informed decision on which takes to use. Automatically aligning the takes on
different tracks in the DAW would be an easy way to make such comparisons.
