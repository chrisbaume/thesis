\chapter*{A note on writing style}
Throughout this thesis, the term ``we'' is used to refer to the author's own work. This acknowledges that that the work
has been influenced by discussions with supervisors and colleagues, and follows recent trends in academic writing
style.  At times when a statement represents the sole opinion of the author, or when reader is invited to think
alongside, or perhaps disagree with, the author, phrases such as ``the author believes'' are deliberately used.

 %Throughout this thesis the term ``we'' is used (in line with recent trends in academic writing) to refer to the
 %author’s work, which is influenced by numerous discussions with his thesis supervisor, faculty and colleagues. This
 %fact is acknowledged through the use of the plural form, except in cases where its use invites the reader to think
 %alongside, or may well disagree with the author. The thesis may reflect the sole opinion of the author in some cases
 %however. Statements in this category are delineated using phrases such as ``in the author’s opinion'' or the occasional
 %use of first person singular.
