\chapter{Introduction}\label{chp:intro}

% RADIO IS HISTORIC
Radio broadcasting is the use of radio waves to transmit sound to a large audience.  The first regular radio broadcasts
in the UK begain in 1922 when a consortium of radio manufacturers formed the British Broadcasting Company.
% RADIO IS POPULAR
Almost a century later, radio is still one of the mass media, with 90\% of the UK adult population listen to the
radio each week for an average of 21 hours \citep{RAJAR2017a}.  In the UK alone, there are 50 national, 329 local and
251 community radio stations \citep[pp. 6, 127]{Ofcom2017}.

% SPEECH PROGRAMMES ARE GAINING POPULARITY THROUGH PODCASTS
Traditionally, radio has been consumed over the airwaves, but the Internet has changed the way audio content is
distributed and consumed.  On-demand radio allows the audience to listen to a radio programme whenever they like, and
podcasting allows them to download audio content as a digital file.  Approximately 10\% of the UK adult population
listen to podcasts \citep{RAJAR2017}, which are mainly speech-based.  Most radio listeners tune in to music-based
stations for background listening and relaxation, but 38\% of the UK population listen to speech-based radio because
they find them interesting \citep[pp.  97, 105]{Ofcom2017}.

% BBC IS BIGGEST RADIO BROADCASTER AND PODCAST SOURCE
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has the largest share of radio listening in UK. Each week, 64\% of the
population listen for an average of 16 hours to its 9 national and 40 local radio stations \citep{RAJAR2017a}.
Globally, the BBC World Service broadcasts radio services in 29 languages to over 269M listeners per week. 
\citep{BBC2017}. The BBC is also the most popular source of podcasts in the UK \citep[p. 107]{Ofcom2017}.
% BBC R&D FUNDED THIS RESEARCH
The research presented in this thesis was conducted during, and as part of, the author's employment at BBC Research and
Development.  BBC R\&D exists to promote technological innovation that supports the BBC's mission to enrich people's
lives with programmes and services that inform, educate and entertain \citep[art. 15]{BBCCharter2016}.  This is
achieved through the research and development of broadcast technology, including for the production and distribution of
audio content.

%Community radio:
%Each community radio station relies on 72 volunteers on average.
%Staffing accounts for over half of all costs in community radio. \citep[p. 116]{Ofcom2017}

\section{Motivation}\label{sec:intro-motivation}

%\subsection{Sound}
% Sound is linear - has a beginning and an end, constrained by the arrow of time
% Cannot be searched or skimmed
% Sound is one-dimensional
% We never stop listening
% Huge range of frequencies and pressure levels

%Audio is an electronic representation of sound which stores pressure waves as an electrical signal.

% Characteristics of sound
One of the distinguishing characteristics of radio is that it is based exclusively on sound.  Although listeners have
no visual reference, sound stimulates the imagination and creates pictures in the mind's eye.  Radio is not limited
by the size of the screen in the way that television is. Sound design and music can be used to produce scenes for
virtually any scenario, which may otherwise be impossible or too expensive to put on screen. As the old adage goes
``the pictures are so much better on the radio''.

Humans use sound to communicate through language and music, which can richly convey complex ideas and elicite powerful
emotion. Despite this, sound is simply the result of vibration in a medium such as air.  As sound is based on vibration
sound cannot be frozen -- it can only exist over a period of time. The temporal nature of sound gives it unique
properties that make it both an interesting and challenging medium to work with.

Unlike pictures, which can be viewed and searched at a glance, sound recordings must be perceived through listening.
The time needed to naturally listen to a sound recording is the same as the length of the recording.  Reviewing long
recordings can therefore take a large amount of time. Sound is also a linear medium that must be played in sequence,
which can make it challenging to navigate sound recordings non-linearly. 
%For example, playing sounds in reverse often makes them incomprehensible.

%From Dhanesha2010:
%It is a common practice for us to skim textual content on a web page. While skimming, we usually skip words or phrases
%that are not of interest to us and we slow down our speed when the content seems to be of relevance to us. But when we
%listen to audio content, which is not persistent and is sequential, such skimming is not possible.

Radio production is a process of recording, selecting and re-arranging audio content. The ability to efficiently
navigate the audio is crucial to the success of this process.  Modern radio production is performed using software
known as a ``digital audio workstation''.  These visualize audio by plotting the amplitude of the audio signal over
time, known as an \textit{audio waveform}.  Waveforms allow users to interact with the audio spatially rather than
temporally, which is thought to be a faster and easier way to navigate audio recordings.  Waveforms display some useful
information, but are limited in the information they can convey.  For example, when viewing a waveform at the right
scale, it is possible for an experienced user to distinguish between speech and music, but it is not usually possible
to determine the style of the music, or what is being said.
%- Modern digital audio workstations are general purpose and not well-suited to most radio production tasks (pic of
%cluttered DAW interface)

%Audio visualization attempts to take advantage of the properties of the human visual system by mapping sound to images.
%This is done to allow listeners to see the sound in a way they can understand and make use of. This approach takes
%advantage of the spatial layout that is possible with images, and the natural searching and skimming capabilities of
%the human visual system.

%- Producers spend much of their time on menial tasks, which is wasteful because the time they spend on this is time
%they can't spend on making the programme better.

%To overcome the challenges that come with the temporal nature of sound, there are a number of technological solutions
%that can be applied. At the very simplest level, sound can be navigated using rewind and fast-forward, to allow
%listeners to re-listen or skip ahead to a sound recording. The playback rate of sound recordings can also be increased,
%but there are limitations to this, which we discuss in Section X. However, in order to navigate sound with purpose, it
%is preferable to be able to understand what is contained within the sound, and to be able to comprehend this
%information efficiently. There have been two main approaches to achieving this -- audio visualization and semantic
%audio analysis.

Semantic audio analysis is the task of deriving meaning from audio. This is achieved by extracting low-level audio
features, such as energy or frequency, and mapping them to a human-readable representation, such as categories or
words.
%Semantic audio analysis refers to a collection of techniques for analysing sound signals to extract human-readable
%information from them. This can be used to map sound to high-level information, such as the name of the person
%speaking, or the text of what they are saying. These techniques can vary from low-level features such as the most
%dominant frequency, to high-level features such as the text of the words that are being spoken. These techniques can
%also be combined with visualization methods to display the results.
%Semantic audio analysis can extract useful information, but how can this best be used?
This research was partly inspired by a conference presentation from \citet{Loviscach2013}, who demonstrated several
prototypes that used semantic audio analysis to assist the editing of recorded speech. These included visualization of
vowels using colour, detecting and highlighting ``umm''s, and identifying repetition. These prototypes were developed
to assist the navigation and editing of lecture recordings using custom video editing software \citep{Loviscach2011a}.

Applying semantic audio analysis techniques to radio production tasks may allow us to produce richer user interfaces
that make it easier and faster for producers to create their programmes.  We are interested in discovering whether this
approach could be used to improve the radio production process, and which techniques work better than others.  As part
of this research, we want to understand how these techniques can best be applied to the production of radio, and make
the process more efficient by reducing the time or effort that is needed to produce the programme. 

%Sound naturally occurs at a consistent rate, so everybody experiences sound over the same length of time.
%This makes it a great medium for shared
%experiences, the kind of which can be witnessed at music festivals. However,

%Working with sound alone makes radio production a much simpler affair than with other media. For example, an interview
%can be recorded using a portable sound recorder by an individual without much training. This simplicity makes radio
%production accessible to amateurs, and the introduction of podcasting has also made it easier for amateurs to
%distribute their own content.

%- transitory nature of radio means it can only be heard at the time of broadcast, no second chances
%Historically, the temporal nature of sound and radio mean that listeners could only hear a programme at the time it was
%broadcast, and once it was heard it was gone. Nowadays, the Internet has facilitated the introduction of on-demand
%listening and podcasting that have changed the wa

%Sound is defined as vibrations that travel through a medium, typically air, which humans perceive through their ears.
%As it is based on vibration, sound cannot exist in a moment -- it can only take place over a period of time.
%Sound is linear, as it is based on a sequence of motion.
%It is experienced at a consistent rate, which cannot naturally be increased or desreased.

% challenges of sound
%This time-based nature of sound gives it a fascinating character.
%However, the time-based nature of sound comes with a variety of challenges.
%Sound cannot be experienced instantanously, as it is the change in air pressure which produces sound.
%As such, it takes time to consume sound.
%For consuming long sound recordings, this property means that listening requires an investment of time.
%In radio production, much of the time required to produce a programme must be committed to listening to the sound that has been recorded.
%The purpose of listening to the sound includes a variety of reasons, including reminding themselves of what
%was said, working out whether the sound quality is acceptable, deciding which bits of the recording to use, and many
%more.

%- Although radio production has turned digital, it has not undergone a technological revolution and the workflow
%remains almost exactly the same

%- Digital communication has allows producers greater flexibility and quality in getting content, but the editing
%process is still analogous to cutting and pasting tape

% BBC situation
As we shall see in Section~\ref{sec:background-radio}, radio production has not been subject to much previous academic
research.  The author's position within the BBC gives us extraordinary access to production staff and working
environments that would otherwise be inaccessible to most researchers. We view this as a rare opportunity to conduct
research that directly involves professional radio producers and takes place within a genuine work environment.

Making radio production more efficient may free up resources that could be spent on producing higher quality content,
or used to making financial savings. The BBC spent \textsterling471M on radio production in 2016/17 \citep[p.
111]{Ofcom2017}, so even minor improvements to production workflows could make large savings.  We are also interested
in making radio production a more enjoyable and creative experience, where producers spend less time on boring, menial
tasks and more time on activities that contribute to the quality of the programme output.

%TODO Why radio and not television?

\section{Aim and scope}\label{sec:aim}

The aim of this work is to develop and evaluate methods for radio production that improve the production process, such
as by increasing the efficiency, reducing the effort required or opening up new creative possibilities.

% - not including live production, which is already efficient
Most radio is broadcast live, where the audio production happens in real-time, but in these cases there is no
opportunity to make the audio production more efficient. For this reason, we have chose to focus only on the production
of pre-produced audio content.

% - speech, not music
Music-based radio programmes are more popular, but most original radio content is speech-based. We will therefore
focus our resarch on the production of speech content.

% make use of BBC producers
We want to make the most of the access to professional radio producers and work environments that are available to us.
To do this, we will specifically target radio producers, by involving them in the development and evaluation of our
work, and conducting evaluations in the workplace.

%where the sound is mixed and produced as the audience listeners to it.
%Although there
%are hours of planning and preparation that go into a live radio broadcast, the actual audio production happens in
%real-time, so there is no opportunity to make the audio production more efficient.  However, many radio programmes are
%pre-produced, where the sound is recorded before transmission.  In these cases, more audio is recorded than is
%required, and audio editing is used to reduce the length, remove unwanted sounds and re-arrange the material into the
%final programme. This process creates overheads for the producers.  This editing process creates overheads for the
%producers, so there are opportunities to make this audio production process more efficient.  For this reason, we chose
%to focus our research on radio programmes that are fully or partly produced in advance of broadcast, and in particular
%on the audio editing stage of radio production.

% - do not include tools for automatically editing (computer based decisions)
%Radio production is a creative endeavour and 
Finally, the intention behind this research is to facilitate creative expression, rather than replace it through
automation.  The aim is to find ways for machines and humans to work to each of their strengths, where simple and
menial tasks are automated, but there is always a ``human in the loop'' that makes the decisions.  Our hope is
that in addition to making production activities more efficient, this may unlock opportunities for greater creative
expression.

\section{Thesis structure}\label{sec:intro/structure}

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{chp:background}} introduces the previous research which we will build our work upon. We start
by giving a general overview of radio production and semantic audio to provide context to our research. We then survey
related techniques and previous systems that have attempted to assist the navigation and editing of audio. These are
categorized into audio visualization, textual representation and audio playback interfaces. We conclude by reflecting
on this existing work to consider a strategy for achieving our research aim.

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{chp:ethno}} investigates existing audio editing workflows in radio production. Our aim is to
better understand the roles, environment, tools, tasks and challenges involved in real-life radio production, to help
inform the direction of our research.  We achieve this by conducting three ethnographic case studies of news, drama and
documentary production at the BBC. The results of this study present three directions for further research, which we
explore through technical intervention in the following three chapters.

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{chp:colourised}} evaluates the effect of audio visualization on radio production.  Semantic
audio analysis techniques have previously been used to generate visualizations for assisting the navigation of audio
recordings. However, the effect this has on user performance is unclear.  We conduct a user study that quantitatively
measures the performance of three audio visualization techniques for a typical radio production task.

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{chp:screen}} investigates semantic speech editing in the context of real-life radio production.
Previous semantic speech editing systems have been evaluated under laboratory conditions, or not at all.  We develop a 
semantic speech editor that integrates with the BBC's radio production systems.  We then describe our qualitative
user study of BBC radio producers, who used our editor in the workplace to produce radio programmes for broadcast.  We
directly compare semantic editing to the current production workflow, and gain insights into the limitations of this
approach.

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{chp:paper}} investigates the benefits of paper as a medium for semantic speech editing.  The
findings from Chapters \ref{chp:ethno} and \ref{chp:screen} led us to to develop a novel system for editing speech
recordings on paper, using a digital pen interface. We describe how we worked with radio producers to refine our
prototype, then evaluate our system through a qualitative study of BBC radio producers. We directly compare it with our
semantic speech editor and discuss the relative benefits of paper and screen interfaces for audio editing.

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{chp:conclusions}} concludes the thesis and considers the prospects for further research.
